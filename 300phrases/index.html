			<p id="calibre_link-7" class="heading-l"><a id="calibre_link-8" class="calibre2"></a>Author’s Note</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thank you for purchasing <span class="italic">300 Practical English Words and Phrases.</span> This is the third book in the <span class="italic">Practical English</span> series, and it is intended as a reference for English learners, teachers, and those who are simply passionate about language. It is meant for self-study, but it can also be used as a classroom resource.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For those who have read my first two books, <span class="italic">100 Practical English Phrasal Verbs</span> and <span class="italic">200 Practical English Idioms</span>, you will be familiar with the structure of this book. However, you will also find some new attributes which enhance the learning experience.</p>
			<p class="heading-l1">What’s new?</p>
			<p class="body-text">In addition to providing definitions, examples, and common sentences, I have added usage explanations, collocations, related phrases, and practice questions. I decided to add these elements in the middle of the writing process because I realized that I was frequently asking myself usage questions about the words and phrases that I was writing about&mdash;and if I was asking questions, then students would definitely ask questions as well. My goal then became to anticipate the questions that students would have, and to answer the questions before students could ask them. In short, I wanted to provide students with as much clarity and context as possible, so they could use the language in this book with absolute confidence.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Because of the additions mentioned above, this book is more detail-heavy than my previous efforts. It requires patience and careful study, but I feel it is a richer experience that will reward students who take the time to absorb its nuances.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As always, my goal is to provide language that people will actually use. This means that as you turn these pages, you will not find words and phrases that have fallen out of use. Instead, you will find common words, phrases, and standalone responses with at least three contemporary examples each to give you language you can start using <span class="italic">right now</span>. </p>
			<p class="body-text">To conclude, I have received a lot of incredibly positive feedback about my first two books, and I am grateful to everyone who has trusted me and my work. With that in mind, I feel this is my best and most complete book. I hope you will too.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Until next time, I wish you success in your studies.</p>

			<p id="calibre_link-10" class="heading-l"><a id="calibre_link-11" class="calibre2"></a>Introduction</p>
			<p class="heading-l1">How to use this book</p>
			<p class="body-text">This book is intended to increase your vocabulary and improve your conversation skills. You can use it as a reference for learning words and phrases that you have read or heard in daily life (scan the index for this approach), or as a guide for learning a few phrases at a time. Like my previous book, I recommend learning three to five new phrases per week. If you feel you can learn more than that, by all means, do it! Just pick a section or group of words and/or phrases that spark your interest, and start reading.</p>
			<p class="heading-l1">About the organization of this book</p>
			<p class="body-text">The organization of this book is a mix of grammatical categories and usage categories. Do you want to learn about common filler and transition words such as “so,” “well,” and “anyway”? You can do that. Do you want to learn about adjective phrases and idioms? You can do that. How about common English commands? You can do that, too. My goal was to sort the book in a way that made sense for most English learners.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Having said that, there are some categorical imperfections. For example, many of the phrases in the prepositions category could be added to the adverbs or adjectives categories. There are also phrases with multiple usages that sometimes function as adjectives, and sometimes function as adverbs. In the end, I decided on a categorization that looks clean to the human eye. This means that all “on” phrases are in the prepositions section, regardless of their function as a true preposition, an adjective, or an adverb. I have noted the relevant grammatical function where necessary.</p>
			<p class="heading-l1">About the use of “one,” “you,” and other pronouns in this book</p>
			<p class="body-text">For definitions, in most cases I have opted to use the word “one” when referring to a subject, and “one’s” when referring to a possessive adjective. This is because “one” and “one’s” encompass all human subjects and possessive adjectives. If you are not familiar with this formal usage of “one” and “one’s,” here is a chart to show what they cover:</p>

			<p class="body-text">I chose to do this because seeing the word “you” in definitions makes learners think of a phrase and its definition from only one perspective. In my opinion, it is better to consider multiple perspectives. This expands our minds by forcing us to think of “he/she/we/they” examples in addition to “you” and “I” examples. This is important when you are&mdash;or one is&mdash;learning a language.</p>
			<p class="body-text">However, there are some situations, such as when discussing commands, where I have used “you” in the definition&mdash;because the subject of a command is always the second person singular or plural. Using “one” multiple times in some definitions can also become confusing, so I have used “you” where I feel it makes sense.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Regarding pronouns in the explanation portion of each entry, I have used the singular “they” instead of writing “he/she” every time. This is much simpler and easier to read. Note this example from the second usage of “Bring it in”:</p>
			<p class="quote">“When it is said, the speaker usually has their arms in an open posture, inviting the person or group they are addressing to hug them.”</p>
			<p class="body-text">I feel this is more pleasant to read than “When it is said, the speaker usually has his/her arms in an open posture, inviting the person or group he/she is addressing to hug him/her.”</p>
			<p class="body-text">I have also used a variety of pronouns (ex: “He/She/We”) in some parts of the book to remind students that many scenarios are possible. Just remember that if you see “I/You/We” at the beginning of an example, it does not mean those are the only options. You are encouraged to try multiple subjects.</p>
			<p class="heading-l1">About the “related phrases” sections in this book</p>
			<p class="body-text">While this book covers 300 words and phrases, there are of course many others that exist. This is why I have not only included collocations&mdash;which are words that commonly go together with the 300 entries in this book&mdash;but also related phrases. I have included the related phrases component to encourage learners to continue studying independently and learning vocabulary that is outside of this book. If you are not familiar with one or more of the related phrases that I have listed, they can be found with an online search. You got this!</p>
			<p class="heading-l1">About the tone of this book</p>
			<p class="body-text">I want my books to feel different than standard reference books. I want them to feel informative and useful, but I also want them to feel fun and approachable. With that in mind, I have tried to make my explanations as clear as possible, but I have also tried to maintain a conversational tone throughout this book. If you see me using contractions in my explanations sometimes, this is why. In short, I want to have a conversation with my readers.</p>
			<p class="heading-l1">About the difficulty level of this book</p>
			<p class="body-text">This book is meant for upper intermediate and advanced English learners. If you are familiar with the CEFR scale, this book is ideal for B2/C1 students. However, students at other levels can still benefit from this book. By studying clear definitions and useful common sentences, an intermediate student (B1) can also improve their spoken and written English skills. Use your discretion.  </p>
			<p class="heading-l1">What’s the best way to learn new vocabulary?</p>
			<p class="body-text">The best way to learn vocabulary is through context, experimentation, and regular revision. This means seeing or hearing a new phrase in a book, movie, real life conversation, or other scenario, finding out what it means, and then trying to use it yourself&mdash;and to use it on a regular basis so you can commit it to memory.</p>
			<p class="body-text">You can also continue context-based learning by reading and studying a book like this one. This book promotes context-based learning in four ways:</p>
			<p class="list-l1-numbered"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">1.</span>By giving a detailed explanation of each word, phrase, or sentence, including usage nuances and common contexts.</p>
			<p class="list-l1-numbered"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">2.</span>By providing multiple examples of each word, phrase, or sentence, so that learners can see the language used in a variety of relevant contexts.</p>
			<p class="list-l1-numbered"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">3.</span>By including at least one common sentence per word, phrase, or sentence, which learners can start practicing immediately.</p>
			<p class="list-l1-numbered"><span class="_idgenbnmarker">4.</span>By including common variations and extensions, as well as similar and opposite words, phrases, or sentences.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In the end, you must find the approach that works best for you. I wish you success in your studies, and I hope you discover the many benefits this book has to offer! </p>

			<p id="calibre_link-14" class="heading-l"><a id="calibre_link-15" class="calibre2"></a>Acknowledgements</p>

			<p id="calibre_link-17" class="heading-l"><a id="calibre_link-18" class="calibre2"></a>COMMANDS, SUGGESTIONS, AND ENCOURAGEMENT</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">This chapter features imperative sentences you can use to give people commands, suggestions, or encouragement. Practice saying the sentences as they are written and do the practice questions to further test your understanding and practice your conversation skills. Please note that some of the entries in this chapter do not include a common sentences component, as the entries are the common sentences.</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-19"></a>Bring it in.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for encouraging someone to bring something inside<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variation:</span> “Bring them in” (for plural objects)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Should I leave my bag outside?” “No. Bring it in.”<br class="calibre6" />“Those groceries look heavy. I’ll help you bring them in.”<br class="calibre6" />“I think you would enjoy that book. I have a copy at home. I’ll bring it in tomorrow.” (I’ll bring it from my home to our workplace.)</p>
			<p class="description">This is the most literal usage of this phrase. When you say “Bring it in,” you are encouraging someone to bring something that is outside into a building/a room/etc. You can modify this to “Bring them in” for plural objects.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage notes:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Someone can also use “Bring it in” to talk about bringing something from their home to their place of work, as in example 3.</span></p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	Who normally brings in the groceries in your home?</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">2.</span>“Give me a hug”; come here and hug me or hug the group</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“It was so good to see all of you again. I’m going to miss you. Bring it in!” <br class="calibre6" />“I’m sorry.” “It’s okay. I forgive you. Bring it in.” <br class="calibre6" />“I’ve had a terrible day.” “Forget about it. Come here and bring it in.”</p>
			<p class="description">This encouraging command is only made to a person or group of people whom you are familiar with. When it is said, the speaker usually has their arms in an open posture, inviting the person or group they are addressing to hug them. The “it” in the context of “Bring it in” can be understood as “Bring the love in” or “Bring your body into my arms.” It is a way of inviting someone to make a physical connection with you. Three common contexts for this phrase are goodbyes, reconciliations, and offers of emotional support.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “give [someone] a squeeze”</span></p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	When was the last time you hugged someone? What can you say next time you want to hug someone?</p>
			<p class="meaning1"><span class="bold">3.</span>get closer to each other; gather in closer proximity</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Bring it in, everybody! Cheers to the new year!”<br class="calibre6" />“Bring it in, team! Let’s talk about our strategy for the second half!” <br class="calibre6" />“Mom, you’re not in the picture. Bring it in.” (Context: taking a selfie with one’s mom)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Bring it in, everybody/team/guys!”</span></p>
			<p class="description">This is used to encourage people to gather together in closer proximity. Some common contexts for this usage include a sports coach telling their team to make a circle around them, or someone who is taking a group photo who wants everyone to get closer together.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “huddle up”</span></p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	Imagine you take a group picture of your friends and/or family. What do you say if you want them to get closer together?</p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-20"></a>Check it out.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>“Look at this/that”; give your attention to the person or thing I am looking at, listening to, etc. <br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variations:</span> “Check this out”; “Check that out.” (Usage depends on one’s proximity to the person/place/thing/etc.)<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “take a look,” “have a look”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Check it out. There’s a sale at the electronics store.”<br class="calibre6" />“Check that out. There’s a kitten sleeping on that woman’s head.”<br class="calibre6" />“Hey, check it out. This is Gina’s new boyfriend.” (Your friend is showing you a picture of Gina’s new boyfriend.)</p>
			<p class="description">Use this imperative when you want to direct someone’s attention to 	something. It can be a picture, a video, a person, or anything that catches your interest and that you want the other person to see.</p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	Look at something around you and say “Check it out.” What is interesting about what you are looking at?</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">2.</span>try this; experience this</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Wow, this is a really cool song. Check it out.” (Or, “Check out this song.”)<br class="calibre6" />“I think you’ll really like this soup. Check it out.”<br class="calibre6" />“The MOMA in New York is an incredible art gallery. You should check it out.”</p>
			<p class="description">You can encourage someone to try or sample something new, such as a piece of media (ex: a song), a physical place (ex: an art gallery), or an event (ex: a concert). You can use “Check it out” in person or in writing. For example, you can send someone an interesting picture from your phone and type “Check it out.” This is a way of saying “Hey, look at this.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related sentences:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Take a look at this/that.” “Try it/this/that out.”</span></p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	Have you checked out any new restaurants, stores, or places recently?</p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-21"></a>Don’t worry about it.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>do not concern yourself with it; you do not need to worry about it</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Oops. I forgot to clean my plate.” “Don’t worry about it. I’ll do it.”<br class="calibre6" />“Do you want to sit? I can get an extra chair.” “Don’t worry about it. I’ve been sitting all day. I can stand.”<br class="calibre6" />“Here’s the five dollars that I owe you.” “Don’t worry about it. I gave it to you because I wanted to. I’m sure you would do the same for me.”</p>
			<p class="description">If someone says “Don’t worry about it,” they mean the situation is not major to them, or that they will handle the situation. It’s similar to saying “It’s not a problem,” or “It’s not a big deal.”  b</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related sentences:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s not a big deal.” “It’s not a problem.” “No worries.”</span></p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	If you paid for a friend’s meal and they offered to pay you back later, would you say “Okay” or “Don’t worry about it”?</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">2.</span>a substitute phrase for “You’re welcome”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Thanks for your help yesterday.” “Oh, don’t worry about it.”<br class="calibre6" />“Thank you for helping Jill with her homework.” “Don’t worry about it.”<br class="calibre6" />“Thanks for lending me those ten dollars.” “Don’t worry about it.”</p>
			<p class="description">This is one of many casual ways to say “You’re welcome” after someone has thanked you. Use this with people you are familiar with and comfortable with.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related sentences:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Don’t mention it.” “It was nothing.” “No problem.”  “No big deal.” “Not at all.”</span></p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	Someone in your family says “Thanks for your help yesterday.” How do you respond?</p>
			<p class="phrase">“Go for it!”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>attempt what you want to achieve; try hard to get what you want; do it</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“That’s a great idea for a website. Go for it!”<br class="calibre6" />“This job sounds perfect for you. You should go for it!”<br class="calibre6" />“You think you can get a higher score? Go for it! I’d like to see you try.”</p>
			<p class="description">This can be used in three different ways:<br class="calibre6" />1)	genuine encouragement (“That sounds great! Go for it!”)<br class="calibre6" />2)	a sarcastic response (“You think you can do better? Go for it.”)<br class="calibre6" />3)	a suggestion (“It sounds like a good opportunity. He should go for it.”)</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is often used to encourage people to take advantage of opportunities, such as job postings. The word “it” refers to the thing the person wants to achieve. If there is more than one option, you can specify which option you think the person should “go for.” Note the examples: “Go for the yellow one”; “If I were you, I’d go for the second job.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related sentences:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Get after it.” “Give it a go.”</span></p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	When was the last time you really went for something? (This means you put all of your effort and energy into it. Ex: “The last time I really went for something was when I applied for my current job.”)</p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-22"></a>How about…?”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for making a suggestion or offer<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “Why don’t…?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“We need to call someone who’s good at math.” “How about Tanya?<br class="calibre6" />“How about a game of chess?” (I want to play chess with you.)<br class="calibre6" />“What do you want to do?” “How about watching a movie?” (Or, “How about we watch a movie?”)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “How about no?” (This is a sarcastic or angry response you can use when someone suggests doing something that you are not interested in. “How about we go to the park?” “How about no?”)</span></p>
			<p class="description">You can use “How about” in a couple of different ways. It can be used as a replacement for “I think we should do this/that.” It can also be used as a replacement for “Here is one idea we can consider.” Only the speaker really knows the intended usage when they say it. This means the speaker can try to persuade others to choose their preferred option, but they can make it sound like it’s “just an idea.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Follow “How about” with a subject or verb+ing. Note the examples: “How about we go to the beach?” “How about going to the beach?”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Do not confuse “How about” with “What about.” “What about” is used to mention a person, object, or potential problem. For example: “Let’s invite Tim and Lisa.” “What about Rob?” “Oh, right. We should invite him too.” In casual speech, “What about” is sometimes accepted to make suggestions in the same way as “How about,” but it should be avoided.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “We could...” “Why don’t we...?”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Keep going.” (Depending on the context, this encourages someone to continue moving in a particular direction, or to continue working or doing something in a particular way.)</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Keep” is followed by a verb+ing for this usage.</span></p>

The second usage is usually said emphatically.)</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Let’s” is a contraction of “Let us” and therefore includes the speaker and listener(s) in its suggestion.</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Take a look at this”; “Have a look at this.”</span></p>
			<p class="description">This sentence is used to encourage someone to look at or examine something. It can be used to ask someone to help you fix something that you don’t know how to fix (“Could you take a look at this?”).

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Why don’t you stay here while I…?” (+base verb)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Depending on your tone, this phrase can introduce a neutral suggestion or an angry one. “Why don’t we try a different restaurant?” can be said in a gentle way or in an irritated way, for instance.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Why don’t” is followed by an object and base verb (ex: “Why don’t you call her?”).</span></p>

			<p class="description">This sentence is used to encourage someone who is going to attempt to succeed at something, such as an exam, a job interview, a meeting, etc. It can also be used to encourage someone in low-risk situations, such as trying a new cooking recipe or trying to pass a challenging section in a video game. It’s similar to saying “I believe in you.” You can also use this in a question form if you want to ask the person if they feel confident about something. Ex: “You got this?” “Yeah, I got this.” Asking “You got this?” in this way is similar to asking “Can you do this?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Do not confuse “You got this” with “You got it,” which means you know, understand, or understood something. Note the examples: “So, the party starts at 9pm?” “Yep. You got it”; “Is this the right answer?” “That’s right. You got it.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">This phrase is often used when you are telling a story. The story can be something that happened to you or someone else, or it can be a fiction. When used effectively, it can add an exciting element or twist to your story.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “All of a sudden” is typically used at the beginning of a new sentence. However, you can use it in the middle if you add the word “when” in front of it, or after a coordinating conjunction, usually “and.” For instance: “I was taking a shower when all of a sudden, I heard a huge crash.” “I was thinking about the problem, and all of a sudden, I thought of a solution.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">This phrase is not a consistent synonym for “sometimes.” For example, “You should call me at times” doesn’t have the same feeling or regularity of usage as “You should call me sometimes.” However, “Sometimes, I don’t want to talk to anyone” and “At times, I don’t want to talk to anyone” are both relatively common. “At times” focuses on specific occasions and moments, while “sometimes” has a more general feeling of time. “At times” is often used to express doubt or worry, as in examples 1 and 3, and the common sentence above.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase can be used at the beginning or at the end of a sentence, but it is more effective when used at the beginning. </span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “We message each other from time to time”; “We talk from time to time.” (This is a common response to someone who asks if you still have contact with someone you both know. For example: “Do you still talk to Denise?” “Yeah. I text her from time to time.”)</span></p>
			<p class="description">In addition to being either at the beginning or at the end of a sentence, “from time to time” can be used as a standalone response. For example: “Do you still go to the gym?” “From time to time.”</p>

			<p class="description">This phrase can be used at the beginning of a sentence, the end of a sentence, or in the middle of a sentence before a main verb. For example: “As they entered the dark room, they once again felt scared.” This phrase can also have a similar feeling to “as usual” in some contexts. For instance: “Once again, you have lied to me and disappointed me.” In this case, the speaker is clearly frustrated with the listener, and there is a sense that the listener often lies and disappoints the speaker.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Once again” is similar to “once more” in many contexts, but the focus with “once more” is on doing something just one extra time. Because of this, it can be used with adverb phrases such as “at least” and “at most,” while “once again” can’t. For example: “I’d like you to try it once more at least”; “We’ll need to do it once more at most.” The phrase “once again” cannot be used in these situations.</span></p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	Express disappointment by starting a sentence with “Once again.” (Ex: “Once again, I have to clean up the house by myself.”)</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Call me once in a while.” (This is an encouraging sentence to a friend whom you want to contact you more regularly.

			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">The phrases in this chapter function as nouns. Many of them are idiomatic. The vast majority of them can be used in the subject or object position of a sentence. Any exceptions are noted.</span></p>
			<p class="phrase"><span class="italic"><a id="calibre_link-39"></a></span>a blast from the past</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>something one encounters in the present that was part of one’s distant past, such as a song, movie, toy, etc.; something or someone who surprises you because you had almost forgotten about them<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common extension:</span> “a real blast from the past”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Do you remember our old math teacher, Mr. Carter?” “I haven’t thought about him in years! What a blast from the past.”<br class="calibre6" />“I used to listen to this album all the time as a teenager. Talk about a blast from the past.” (The phrase “talk about” followed by a noun or noun phrase is used to emphasize the noun or noun phrase.)<br class="calibre6" />“I had totally forgotten about that movie. Wow. What a blast from the past.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “That’s a (real) blast from the past.” (That’s something I haven’t thought about in a long time. This can refer to a person, an event, a movie, a song, etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is usually used in a light-hearted (meaning in a cheerful and/or entertaining) way. If you hear a song on the radio that you haven’t thought about for a long time, for example, you might say “Wow! This is a real blast from the past!” You can also use this phrase to talk about something modern that is actually retro and that is trying to be a tribute to something from the past. This means it “feels” old or that it reminds you of something similar that is older. A new video game that uses an older graphics style could be considered “a blast from the past,” for example.</p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	Have you experienced any blasts from the past recently (either by hearing an old song or hearing news about someone you knew a long time ago)?</p>
			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-40"></a>a far cry from [somewhere]</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>a long distance from one place to another; a long way</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Mumbai is a far cry from Berlin.”<br class="calibre6" />“Are you sure you want you work there? It’s a far cry from where you live.”<br class="calibre6" />“She moved to Monaco, which is a far cry from her hometown.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “That’s a far cry from here.” (That place is very far from here.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This is the most literal version of this idiomatic phrase. It simply means that one place is very far from another place, or that you have to “cry” (meaning yell or shout) loudly to communicate between two places. Think of a person standing on a mountain trying to call to a friend who is standing on another mountain that is far away. The two friends are a far cry from each other. This phrase can also be used to refer to figurative distances. For example: “My French skills are a far cry from where I’d like them to be.”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s a far cry from what I’m used to.” (It’s very different from what I’m familiar with.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If something is a far cry from something else, it’s usually not as good as you wanted it to be, or simply not what you expected it to be&mdash;it’s very different. This phrase can simply mean that something is very different or far apart from something else (“Heavy metal music is a far cry from jazz music”), but it can also be used to show your disappointment with something (“This is a far cry from what I expected”).</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “a far cry from one’s expectations,” “a far cry from what one is used to”</span></p>

The kids have zero structure and just do whatever they want all day.”<br class="calibre6" />“I wish you had seen the store on Christmas Eve. It was a free-for-all! People were pushing each other all over the place just to buy gifts.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s a free-for-all.” (It’s a wild, chaotic situation with no rules and no structure.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Some common contexts for this phrase include: people who are competing for products at a store or market, a game where anyone can join, a situation where a group of people are waiting for something but there is no ordered line. For example: “I hate going to buffet restaurants. They’re just one big free-for-all. I don’t like walking around with a plate and bumping into people just so I can eat.” Think of the phrase like this: Things are “free” (open) for “all” (everyone).</p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	Are there any stores or markets that feel like a free-for-all in your area? (This does not mean things are free, but that the places are chaotic.)</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Case in point.” (Used as a standalone response to say “That is a good example of what we are discussing or trying to say.”)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase to point to an example of what you are discussing. It’s similar to saying “An example of my point.” This phrase is usually used at the beginning of a new sentence, but it can be put at the end as well, as in example two. It can also be used as a standalone response to say “See? That’s a perfect example of what I’m talking about.” For instance:<br class="calibre6" />A: “We shouldn’t hire him.”<br class="calibre6" />B: “You’re probably right.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Just some food for thought.” (This is just something for us to consider or think about.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase means “Here is something to think about.” It is very often used in the sentence “Here’s some food for thought,” followed by the thing you want the other person to consider/think about. It can be used as a standalone phrase after you make a point. In this case, it is often expanded to “Just some food for thought.” For example: “If you vote for him, what will the consequences be for your kids? Just some food for thought.”</p>
			<p class="description">You can use this phrase to show that you are not being aggressive in a discussion because you just want someone to consider a particular idea. However, depending on your tone and what you said prior, it can be used to show that you think your ideas are superior.</p>

For instance, “Your mom is one of a kind” can have a positive or negative meaning depending on the tone of your voice and the context of the discussion.</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can use the hyphenated form “one-on-one” when you’re using this as an adjective in front of a noun or noun phrase. For example: “They offer one-on-one classes.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">This phrase is often used by insurance and home security companies. For example: “What if your house is flooded tomorrow? With our premium home insurance plan, you can have peace of mind.” Peace of mind is very often something you “want,” “need,” or “have.” Something or someone can also “give” you peace of mind.</p>
			<p class="description">If you have peace of mind, you are free from worry&mdash;your mind and your body can relax. You can have peace of mind about certain things in your life, but not in others. For example: “I’m glad my kids are staying with their grandparents today. It gives me peace of mind that they won’t get into any trouble. I’m still worried about where they’ll go to school next year, though.”</p>
			<p class="description">Sometimes, “peace of mind” simply means that someone or some entity (such as a company, a bank, a government office, etc.) finally makes a decision that affects you, so you can stop worrying about the decision. Even if the decision is not what you wanted (a company doesn’t hire you, for example), you have peace of mind because you are no longer wondering about and waiting for the decision.</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “From my point of view,...” (followed by your opinion)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Your point of view is how you see things. Our points of view are affected by our past experiences, our current knowledge of a situation, our internal biases, and anything else that affects our beliefs and opinions about a particular topic. In civil conversation, it is considered polite to respect another person’s point of view even if you disagree with it. (There are of course limits to this in any society.)</p>
			<p class="description">People “have” a point of view. You can also ask someone what their point of view “is” (“What’s your point of view?”). This is basically asking someone’s opinion about a particular topic. Points of view are discussed in any situation where people gather to reach a consensus or to increase their understanding of a topic.</p>

There were so many things we didn’t know.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s trial by fire.” (It’s a difficult, high pressure situation that reveals something about one’s character.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase comes from the medieval practice of determining if someone was guilty of a crime, by having them complete a difficult task, such as walking barefoot through a fire. You can “pass” a trial by fire. This phrase is similar to “baptism by fire,” which refers to learning something new that is difficult because of a person’s lack of experience.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “a sink or swim environment” (ex: “That company doesn’t offer a lot of support. It’s a sink or swim environment”), “a sink or swim situation”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I heard it through word of mouth.”</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is often used in marketing and promotion. Many people believe that even in the technological age, “word of mouth” is still the most powerful form of advertising. This means that if you like a product, you will tell your friends, who will tell their friends, and so on. The word of mouth on something can be positive, negative, strong, or weak. For instance, if it seems like people aren’t talking about something (ex: a new movie), you could say “The word of mouth on that movie isn’t really strong.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is also often preceded by “through.” This refers to how something is communicated&mdash;in this case, through word of mouth.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “positive </span><span class="charoverride2">word of mouth,” “strong word of mouth,” “through word of mouth”</span></p>

			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Just like an adjective, an adjective phrase describes or gives more information about a noun. Many noun phrases can become adjective phrases. For example, you can say “That statue is one of a kind” (see: “one of a kind” in noun phrases), or “That’s a one-of-a-kind statue.” Just like adjectives, adjective phrases can be used in the present, past, and future. They are also often preceded by a form of the verb “to be.” For example: “You are better off alone” (see: “better off” below).</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m used to it.” (I’m accustomed to it.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">You can be used to something or someone, but this phrase most often refers to places, things, habits, and activities. For instance, you can be used to cold weather, living in the city, pineapple on pizza, or sleeping on the floor. The negative form is “be not used to.” For example: “I’m not used to my job yet.” This means you are still learning to feel comfortable at your job.</p>
			<p class="description">Another common context is when you have become comfortable with a bad situation. For example: “I’m used to working for free”; “He’s used to bad news. He has had a hard life”; “We were used to poor treatment.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note 1:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Be used to” can be followed by numerous things, including nouns (apartments, football), noun phrases (my dad’s cooking), gerunds (hiking, watching), and more. For example: “She’s used to going to bed early.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note 2:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Be used to” is most often used in the past simple, present simple, and future simple tenses: “I was used to it”; “I’m used to it”; “I will </span><span class="charoverride2">be used to it.” However, it is more common to hear “I will get used to it” for the future tense (see “get used to”).</span></p>

			<p class="description">While this phrase often refers to your financial position in life, you can be better off physically, mentally, emotionally, etc. This phrase simply means you were, you are, or you will be in a better position. A common context for this phrase is encouraging someone after they have ended a relationship. In particular, it’s common to say “You’re better off without him/her/them,” which means “You are in a better position because you are not with that person anymore. They were not good for you.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Because this is such a versatile phrase, it can be followed by an adverb (“You’re better off here”), a present participle (“She’s better off quitting her job”), or a preposition (“I was better off in Paris”).</span></p>

It is usually used with new habits or new realities in our lives. It is often used in the present continuous to state that we are still in the process of becoming accustomed to something new.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can follow this adjective phrase with a gerund to tell people what the subject is doing while they are out and about. For example: “He’s out and about looking for a job.” This means he is probably visiting companies directly and submitting his resume to them.</span></p>

			<p class="description">If something is out of the question, it is not something a person wants to hear about or think about as an option. This phrase is typically used after someone makes a suggestion, a request, or has an idea that is rejected by someone else. For example: “Can I borrow your new car?” “Sorry, but that’s out of the question.” This phrase gives someone a strong “No” response.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Out of the question” is most often preceded by a form of the verb “to be.” While it can be used as a quick and strong standalone response, its two most common uses are “That’s out of the question” and “It’s out of the question.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “No way, no how,” “out of the realm of possibility”</span></p>

She’s usually late for work.)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “That’s (just) par for the course.” (That’s what usually happens or what I expected to happen. I am not surprised at all.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase to show that you are not surprised by a piece of news that someone gives you, or to say “See? This is what you can expect from this person. Don’t act surprised when they do what they have always done.” For example: “The judge said there wasn’t enough proof to convict the thief even though there was video evidence.” “That’s par for the course in our justice system.”</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase comes from the game of golf, where you are expected to get the ball in the hole in a certain number of turns. If you get the ball in the expected number of turns, you “hit par.” Therefore, if you hit par for the course&mdash;meaning you hit par on all 18 holes of golf&mdash;you do what you are expected to do on that course.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Par for the course” can be used as a quick standalone response to someone, but it’s most often used in the sentence “That’s par for the course.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">This phrase is used to indicate that something has a large amount of something in it.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s (already) spoken for.” (Someone else has already reserved it or expressed their interest in it.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase can be used to talk about objects, places, or people. In a shop, a customer might ask for a specific item, but the owner might say “I’m sorry. This one is already spoken for.” This means the item is being reserved for someone else because they have already expressed (“spoken”) their desire to purchase it, and they have already paid for it as well. In a movie theatre, you can say “These spoken for” to someone who wants to take two or more seats that are already reserved beside you. In this context, however, it is more common to say “I’m sorry. These are reserved” or “These are taken.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> A person can be “spoken for” as well, but this is an old-fashioned usage. A man might say “She is spoken for” to mean that his girlfriend or wife is not single. They are already “reserved” for them. “He/She is already taken” is another way of saying this.</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “That was uncalled for.” (That was unnecessary and unjustified.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If someone says “That was uncalled for,” they mean “No one asked you to say or do that, and you should have just said or done nothing instead.” Words or actions that are uncalled for usually feel excessively harsh or critical. They are unwanted and unnecessary. A person who says or does things which are uncalled for does not respect social rules. For example, if a boxer is on the ground, but their opponent gives them an extra punch, the commentator might say “That was uncalled for! He was already down!”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is usually used in the past, but it can be used in the present as well, usually in this form: “That’s uncalled for.”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He’s/She’s up and about somewhere.” (He’s/She’s awake and somewhere in the house/area/etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you’re up and about, you’re out of bed and active. The first context for this phrase is that a person is no longer sleeping (“I’m usually up and about at 7 o’clock”) or they are not sleeping yet (“Is she still up and about, or has she gone to bed?”). The second context for this phrase is that a person has had an illness, injury, or operation. For example, a doctor might tell a patient, “You should be up and about in two or three days” after an operation. This means the person will be mobile and able to leave their bed to do regular activities in two or three days.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Follow “up and about” with a verb+ing to say what someone is doing. For example: “He’s up and about cleaning his room.” This means he is awake, out of bed, and cleaning his room.</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s </span><span class="charoverride2">up for grabs.” (It’s available to be won or taken by anyone who wants it, or who wants to try to get it.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">To get a better image of this expression, imagine someone throwing a chocolate bar into the air, and a lot of hands reaching up to grab it.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase usually comes at the end of a sentence and often follows the structure “X is/are (not) up for grabs.” For example: “If anyone wants it, my camera is up for grabs.

			<p class="description">While this phrase often refers to your financial position in life, you can be worse off physically, mentally, emotionally, etc. This phrase simply means you were, you are, or you will be in a worse position.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Because this is such a versatile phrase, it can be followed by an adverb (“I was worse off there”), a present participle (“You’re worse off not doing anything”), or a preposition (“I was worse off with him”).</span></p>

			<p class="description">This phrase is almost always used in the common sentence, “It’s about time.” This sentence can be used to show your relief that something has finally happened or is going to happen. Before this point in time, you may have felt frustrated, annoyed, impatient, or just upset that something hadn’t happened yet&mdash;or you had stopped expecting it to happen.</p>
			<p class="description">You can also use this phrase to give someone life advice or a push in the right direction. For example: “It’s about time that you learned how to drive”; “It’s about time you got your own apartment.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s about time” can be followed by the following:</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">1)	A “that” clause with the simple past: “It’s about time that we left.” In this case, the past simple “left” still refers to the present moment, as “It’s about time” is similar to a conditional or an “I wish” situation. You can also omit the “that” in this structure. For example: “It’s about time you got a job.”</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">2)	A “to”-infinitive: “It’s about time to leave.” In this case, you are saying it is time to go. This can be a statement of fact or a suggestion.</span></p>

This phrase is preceded by a “be” verb, and is most often used in the present (“I’m about to start preparing dinner”) and the recent past (“She was just about to make a huge mistake”). These cases are similar to “I’m going to start preparing dinner” and “She was going to make a huge mistake.” These decisions and actions seem(ed) imminent. It’s possible they’re going to happen&mdash;as in the case of “I’m about to start preparing dinner,” where the intention is clear that this person will prepare dinner&mdash;or maybe they won’t, as in the case of “She was about to make a huge mistake,” where it seems like something stopped her from making a huge mistake.</p>
			<p class="description">“Be about to” can also refer to events that seem or seemed imminent, even if they’re happening to objects. For example: “The building is about to collapse”; “My computer is about to shut down”; “Your phone was about to fall off the table, so I grabbed it.”</p>

			<p class="description">A common usage of this phrase is “As far as I know.” Another way to understand this usage is: “Based on what I know,” or “This is the extent or degree of my knowledge on this topic.” For example: “As far as I know, our new computers are supposed to be delivered tomorrow.” This is the information I have heard about the delivery of our new computers. I might be right or I might be wrong. I am just telling you what I know. This sentence can also be used as a standalone response. For instance: “Is your cousin doing okay after the accident?” “As far as I know.” This means “Based on the most recent information I have, he is doing well.”</p>

			<p class="description">If you do something at the drop of a hat, you do it almost immediately&mdash;like a reflex. This can be because of your character or because of a strong external motivator. For example: “My boss yells at his employees at the drop of a hat.” In this case, the boss is someone who gets angry easily. Imagine someone dropping their hat, and someone else doing something before the hat touches the floor. This is the basic idea behind this phrase. “At the drop of a hat” could refer to any action, either positive or negative.</p>

This is often asked about a person’s travel time to and from work or school.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">You can do many things back and forth. For instance, you can travel back and forth, message back and forth, or argue back and forth with someone. The idea is there is a constant cycle of movement from one point (one place or person) to another. People often talk about how long it takes them to travel to school or work, and back to their home again. For example: “It takes me three hours to travel back and forth between my house and my job.” If you’re anxious or angry about something, and you feel like you need to stand up and walk back and forth to help you process your emotions or just do something physical, you can say “I paced back and forth.”</p>

			<p class="description">If you do something by yourself, you do it with no assistance from anyone.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Early on, I wasn’t sure.” (I had doubts in the early stages of the process/activity/relationship/etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is not a simple replacement for the word “early.” For example, you cannot say “I got to school early on.”</p>
			<p class="description">A similar-looking phrase to “early on” is “earlier on,” which means “before now.” For example: “Earlier on, I told you what I had for breakfast.” This means I spoke with you earlier in the day, and I told you what I had for breakfast. “Earlier on” is a simple replacement for the word “earlier” and can be used in all cases where “earlier” can also be used. This means it can be used in the previous paragraph example above, “I got to school earlier on,” which means “I got to school earlier.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocation:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “know early on” (ex: “I knew early on that…” as in “I knew early on that if I wanted to pass the test, I would need to study hard.”)</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s not bad in and of itself.” (Intrinsically, it isn’t bad.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This is a semi-formal phrase that is used for emphasis. You can use it to assess the value or quality of something out of its context. It focuses on the basic nature of something. In this way, the phrase can be used to mean “intrinsically” or “by itself.” While it’s often used in negative sentences (“It’s not a bad thing in and of itself”), it can be used in positive cases as well (“Nature is beautiful in and of itself”).</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can use “in and of itself” at the start, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence. See the examples above. Note the punctuation.</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Off the top of your head, can you name all of the countries in Asia?”<br class="calibre6" />“Do you remember Larry’s phone number?” “Not off the top of my head.”<br class="calibre6" />“What’s a good lunch restaurant around here?” “I can name at least 3 off the top of my head.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Not off the top of my head.” (I do not have this information readily available in my brain. If you want me to give you a proper answer, I will need time to think of it or to investigate it.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you say something off the top of your head, you say it without thinking carefully or having time to investigate things properly. If a person asks if you know something, can think of something, or can remember something off the top of your head, they want a quick answer&mdash;now! In the moment! Here are two more examples: “Off the top of your head, do you remember the name of the market we visited in Buffalo?” “Tina is amazing at geography. She can name all the capital cities in the world off the top of her head.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is often used in the negative standalone response “Not off the top of my head.” This means “I don’t know this information because I haven’t memorized it,” or “I can’t think of this information immediately.” “Not off the top of my head,” means you could find the information if you were given more time to think about it or investigate it.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “know [something] off the top of one’s head,” “recite [something] off the top of one’s head,” “remember [something] off the top of one’s head”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-84"></a>on one’s own</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>independent of anyone else; alone<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “by oneself”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“She made the decision on her own (with no input from other people).”<br class="calibre6" />“Do you live on your own?”<br class="calibre6" />“You’re on your own.” (You are responsible for yourself and your own survival, and no one is going to help you.)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “You’re on your own.” (See example 3 above. This sentence can also mean that no one shares your situation or your opinion.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Independence is closely associated with this phrase. It means you are free from outside influences. It can be similar to “by oneself” in meaning you are alone. However, there can be a perceived difference in saying “I’m by myself” (I’m alone) and “I’m on my own” (I’m independent). The second example has this meaning in a very specific context. Specifically, if you need help and someone says “You’re on your own,” this means they will not help you&mdash;you are responsible for yourself and your own resources for survival.</p>
			<p class="description">“You’re on your own” can also mean “Sorry, I’m not going to support what you just said.” For example, if someone says “I think we need stronger drug laws” in a room with three other people, and everyone stays silent because it’s clear they don’t agree with this position, one of the people could say “I think you’re on your own.” This means no one shares the idea regarding stronger drug laws. “You’re by yourself” is not used in this context.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “On one’s own” can be used as an adjective (“I am on my own”), or an adverb (“I finished the project on my own”), but for the simplicity of having it closer to “by oneself,” it is included in this chapter.</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Let’s finish this once and for all.” (Let’s do this for the final time ever, so that we have a decisive conclusion.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This is a slightly dramatic phrase that means to do something for the final time. The “for all” portion implies “for all time.” The idea is that you want to do something so it can be finished and decided forever.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “decide [something] once and for all,” “do [something] once and for all,” “end [something] once and for all,” “finish [something] once and for all”</span></p>

			<p class="description">If there is a line of people waiting at the bank, but there is only one bank teller, the bank teller must help the people one by one. This means he/she must help one person, then another, then another, and so on, in an orderly way.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’ll do it right now.” (I will do it immediately.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This is a more emphatic way to say “now.” You can soften it or give it a more playful tone by using the phrase “right about now,” which means “around this exact time.” This phrase is often used to create comedy in stories or real-life situations. For example, in a story, character A might ask character B: “When is it supposed to start raining?” After character A asks this, it starts raining, and character B says: “Right about now.” Brilliant!</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’ll do it right away.” (I’ll do it immediately and as quickly as possible.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you do something right away, you do it almost instantly and as quickly as possible. “Right away” and “right now” share the meaning of doing something immediately, but “right away” can also refer to speed, while “right now” refers to the point in time that something happens or begins to happen.</p>
			<p class="description">You can use “right away” as a standalone response. For example: “Could you get me a glass of water?” “Right away.” This means I’m going to get you a glass of water now, and I will get it quickly. You might hear this usage in the service industry, such as at a restaurant. “Right now” isn’t used in this way.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Right away” is typically used at the end of the sentence, but it can be used in the middle or at the beginning as well.</span></p>

			<p class="description">Doing something step by step means you are doing it in a slow and steady way&mdash;you are following a process. Think about how able-bodied people walk: by taking one step with one foot, another step with the other foot, and so on. It is the same idea when you do something step by step. For example: “If you follow the instructions step by step, you shouldn’t have any problems.” This phrase is often used to encourage others or to discuss instructions for something.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can use “step by step” as an adjective before a noun by hyphenating it: “It’s a step-by-step process.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “a step-by-step process,” “go step by step”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I agree to an extent.” (I agree with you and/or your point to a certain degree, but I don’t agree 100%.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase to mean there is some truth to what someone is saying. It’s similar to saying “You are partially right, but not exactly.” It can also be used as a standalone response. For example: “Are you saying that people with pets are better people?!” “To an extent.” This is a slightly humorous example, but it shows the phrase in action. The most common context for this phrase is an argument. See examples 1 and 3 above for a better idea of this usage.</p>

			<p class="description">You can repeat, say, copy, or write something word for word. This means you repeat something exactly as it was stated. For example: “I know the dialogue in that movie word for word.” This means you can repeat the entire movie from your memory because you have seen it so many times.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can use “word for word” as an adjective by hyphenating it. For example: “It’s hard to do a word-for-word translation of that text.”</span></p>

			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">This chapter focuses on common verb phrases, which include common verb and preposition combinations, idioms, and phrasal verbs. The function of each verb phrase has been noted when necessary. Remember that verbs are action words that describe what a subject is doing. Verb phrases function in the same way.</span></p>

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">phrasal verb (transitive, inseparable)</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>to explain or show where something or someone is; to give an acceptable explanation for something</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“This report doesn’t account for the $2,000 we lost last month.” (The report does not list this amount&mdash;it does not show or explain where it is.)<br class="calibre6" />“I appreciate your apology, but it still doesn’t account for what you did.” (It does not explain the severity of your mistake. Your apology is not enough.)<br class="calibre6" />“This news story doesn’t account for the political situation in the country.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “How do you account for __________?” (How do you explain this?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">When you account for something, you are able to show where it is and/or explain what happened to it. This phrase is often used to discuss money that is missing (usually related to big business or politics), but it can be used in other contexts as well. For example: “Brock says he was at the arena. Is that true?” “I can account for him. I saw him there.” This means I can show or explain his location during a particular time because I was there, too.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “give an explanation for [someone or something]”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">phrasal verb (transitive, inseparable)</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>to take action as a result of receiving orders, new information, advice, etc.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I need you to act on this project starting today.” (I need you to take action.)<br class="calibre6" />“Are we going to act on this?” (Are we going to take action on this?)<br class="calibre6" />“He attacked me, so I hit him.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Are you going to act on it?” (Are you going to do something because of it, or deal with it in some way?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you act on something, you take action because of it or you take action to deal with the thing you are “acting on.” In the first case, you can act on someone’s advice, for instance. For example: “I’m going to act on your advice and send him an email” (I’m going to follow your advice). In the second case, you can take action on something like a work project. See the first example above for this usage.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “act on instinct,” “act on [someone’s] behalf,” “act on [someone’s] orders”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase">add on [something]</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">phrasal verb (transitive, separable)</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>to attach something to something else, or to make it part of it; to include something as part of something else</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“They’re going to add on another room to their house.”<br class="calibre6" />“If you buy our home insurance package, car insurance comes added on.”<br class="calibre6" />“So far, you have ordered three spaghetti meals. Would you like to add on anything else?” (Would you like to add anything else to your order?)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “You can add it on later.” (You can choose to attach it or include it later.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you add something on, you attach it to something else, or include it with something else. For example, a company can choose to add on an extra week of vacation to an employee’s contract. Stores can ask their customers if they want to add on something to a purchase, usually a legal contract such as a warranty. For instance: “Would you like to add on our guaranteed replacement plan to your laptop purchase?” Here is one more example of a common usage of this phrasal verb in the sales industry: “If you buy the car today, I’ll add on free oil changes for one year.” This means the oil changes will be attached or included with the purchase of the car.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You add on something to something else. “We’re thinking about adding on an extension to our house.”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-97"></a>ask for it</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">idiomatic phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>to invite punishment as a result of one’s behaviour; to act in a way that makes people feel like one deserves retribution/punishment<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “ask for trouble”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Why are you teasing me all the time? You’re really asking for it.”<br class="calibre6" />“You punched him?!” “Yeah. He was asking for it!”<br class="calibre6" />“Stop tickling me! I mean it! Okay, that’s it. You asked for it!” (The person might tickle their friend/child/parent/partner/etc. in return.)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “You’re asking for it.” (Stop behaving like that because you are inviting punishment. The context can be serious or a joke.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This idiomatic meaning of “ask for it” is common in situations where someone acts in a way that makes people feel like the person deserves negative consequences for their behaviour. For example, if one of your male friends is singing loudly at a party and making people around him feel annoyed, and someone else at the party steps on your friend’s foot because he wouldn’t stop singing, you might say “He was asking for it.” The “it” refers to a negative consequence. That means he was inviting punishment for his obnoxious behaviour&mdash;he deserved what he received.</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase can be used in a playful way. If someone is bothering you in a way that doesn’t actually bother you, you can say “You’re really asking for it” in a joking way to mean that your friend is going to be in trouble or face punishment if they don’t stop bothering you.</p>
			<p class="description">Unfortunately, this phrase is sometimes used by misogynistic groups when discussing the sexual assault of a woman. “She was asking for it” is a bad argument made to justify sexual assault, as it implies that a woman’s appearance invites assault, and that a man is not responsible for his actions.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is usually used in the past or present continuous tenses. For example: “You’re asking for it”; “You were asking for it”; “I was asking for it,” etc. It is also often used in the past simple (“You asked for it!”) to say “That’s enough. I’m going to punish you now.”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He’s/She’s/They’re asking for trouble.”</span></p>
			<p class="description">You don’t want to ask for trouble! If you ask for trouble, you say or do (or plan to say or do) something that might cause problems for you. This can be in major ways or small ways. For example, if you have a weak stomach and you eat spicy food, you’re probably asking for trouble. You’re also asking for trouble if you drive too fast in a police zone.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is most often used in the present and past continuous tenses: “You’re asking for trouble” or “We were asking for trouble,” for example. “That’s asking for trouble” is also common.

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">phrasal verb (transitive, inseparable)</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>to rely on something or someone 100%; to expect that something will happen, even though it might not; to trust something or someone 100%<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “depend on,” “rely on”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Don’t bank on it.” (Don’t expect it to happen. Don’t have false hope. Don’t invest money or emotional energy in this outcome.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“You can bank on it!” This means you can trust and be confident in “it.” For example: “Manchester United are going to beat Burnley tonight. You can bank on it.” This means you can bet money from the bank on this game because I am so certain the outcome will happen&mdash;even though there is a chance it won’t. This is a common phrase when we want to make a prediction about something and seem confident about it. With this in mind, this sentence is commonly used when you feel confident about the outcome of a sporting event.</p>
			<p class="description">In general, this phrase is used when we feel very good about the chances of a future outcome, or when we want to reassure someone that we know what we are talking about and that they can trust us. For example: “You can always bank on my friendship. I’ll always be here for you.”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s based on a true story.” (It is modeled on something that really happened. It is a true story.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Many movies are based on books. Something can be based on a true story. Someone might say they want to write a story and base it on your life. In all of these cases, a story or point of inspiration or reference is used as a model for another creation. For example: “The book is based on the author’s personal experience.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> While you can use “base on” in its regular form, as in “I will base the book on the Vietnam war,” it is more common to use the form “be based on,” often in the present or past simple. For instance: “The painting is based on the artist’s personal experience” or “I saw the movie that was based on that book.” “Be based on” is inseparable.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be based on a book,” “be based on a true story,” “be based on [someone’s] life,” “be based on true events”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “What do you base that on?” (Why do you think that? What is the reason for your position/belief/etc.?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“What do you base that on?” You might ask this question if you want to understand the source of someone’s ideas. The person might respond, “I base it on scientific evidence.” The person is explaining the source of their belief or argument&mdash;the base or foundation of their knowledge.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> As in usage 1, it is more common to use the form “be based on” instead of simply “base on.” Note the example sentences above.</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “What brought it about?” (What caused it to happen?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">A person can bring about positive change or negative change. A political election can bring about stability or chaos. Your beliefs and opinions can also be brought about by something. In all of these cases, the thing or person who brings about something causes something to happen. In many cases, you can substitute the phrase “bring about” with “bring” or “cause” in your mind for a similar meaning. For instance: “Gandhi helped to bring about Indian independence.” This means Gandhi helped to bring independence to India, or he helped to cause the situation. </p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The common structure for this phrasal verb is: the agent of the change + bring about + the result.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Do you want to chime in on this?” (Do you want to offer your opinion on what we are discussing?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you chime in during a discussion or debate, you enter the discussion or debate and offer your opinion, in the same way a bell chimes and attracts attention. This phrase is common in informal meetings or discussions between friends and colleagues. People usually chime in with suggestions, ideas, opinions, etc. For instance, “Vera, would you like to chime in?” is an invitation for Vera to speak and to offer her thoughts on what is being discussed.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> While “chime in” by itself is intransitive, which means it is not followed by an object, it can be extended to become transitive with two words: “with” and “on.” Note the examples: “He chimed in with a great suggestion”; “They are conducting a public survey because they want regular people to chime in on the debate.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">What is the difference between “come about” and “bring about?” Here are two sentences that illustrate the difference: “Their government brought about war”; “War came about because of their government.” As you can see, “bring about” focuses on the cause of something, while “come about” focuses on the result.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> To mention the cause of what came about, it is common to use “because of” or “as a result of” after “come about.” For example: “The company came about as a result of two women.” This means the company came into existence because of two women. Note the structures that are possible with this phrasal verb by examining the examples above.</span></p>

You can use the standalone response “Don’t count on it” to tell someone that they shouldn’t expect a particular result or occurrence. For example: “Do you think we could ever be together again?” “Don’t count on it.” The second person is telling the first person that their romantic relationship is finished and that the first person should not expect the relationship to start again.</p>

			<p class="description">How you deal with people and with situations determines part of your character. Do you get angry at the smallest thing? Are you calm or do you freeze in stressful situations? If you work at a job where you have to deal with people, how do you manage difficult customers or clients? All of these situations refer to how you deal with things or people&mdash;how you handle or manage them. For example: “I’m dealing with a lot of financial problems” means you currently have financial problems that you are trying to manage. “He’s dealing with the death of his grandmother” means his grandmother died and he is trying to manage his emotions after her death.</p>
			<p class="description">A specific context of this phrasal verb means to handle or manage someone or something that is causing you problems. “I’ll deal with him” means you will handle the situation concerning “him.” Perhaps he works with you and hasn’t been doing his job properly lately, and you need to have a serious conversation with him to discuss his poor performance.</p>

			<p class="description">If something depends on something else, it needs that thing to act in a certain way for the desired outcome. For example: “My future depends on the bank’s decision.” This means you are waiting for an important decision from the bank that will determine something important about your future.</p>
			<p class="description">A common reduced sentence that is related to this phrasal verb is “That depends” or “It depends.” Here is an example of its usage: “Are you coming to the party?” “That depends.” “On what?” “Will Mario be there?” This means your decision will be influenced by Mario’s attendance at the party.</p>
			<p class="description">Another common but dramatic sentence is “My/Your/His/Her life depends on it.” This means one’s life or death is determined or decided by something or someone. As mentioned, you can use this to add some drama to your words.</p>

			<p class="description">“Don’t dwell on the past” means “Don’t think too much about the past because it is unhealthy to do so.” When we dwell on things, we focus on them for an extended period of time. “To dwell” means to live or stay in a place. “A dwelling” is a home. In the same way, if we dwell on something, we let it get comfortable living in our minds. You can dwell on someone as well (“Stop dwelling on him. He’s not worth it”), but this phrasal verb is more commonly used to talk about things. While there are positive uses of this phrasal verb, it is usually used negatively or as a warning to someone.</p>

			<p class="description">The word “embark” means to board a boat, a plane, or other vehicle. Consequently, the idea of beginning a long journey is implied in the phrasal verb “embark on.” With this in mind, it is a slightly formal phrase that can be used to give more importance or drama to your words. For example: “We are going to embark on a long journey. Who’s with me?” The long journey might be a work project or an actual physical journey. It can also be used more neutrally, as in “I’m embarking on a new career” or to discuss your travel plans, as in “We’re embarking on our trip to Brazil tomorrow.”</p>

			<p class="description">“The wayside” refers to the edge of a road. If something falls by the wayside, it is not on the main part of the road anymore. If your schoolwork falls by the wayside, it is pushed away or neglected. You can consciously allow something to fall by the wayside, or it can be the result of outside factors. For example: “After I got sick, my schoolwork fell by the wayside.” This means I became sick and I had to ignore my schoolwork as a result.</p>
			<p class="description">A routine or habit can also fall by the wayside. For instance: “She normally eats healthy, but after taking that stressful job, her diet fell by the wayside”; “After we had our first child, going to the gym fell by the wayside.”</p>

			<p class="description">If you need to be filled in on something, you don’t have the latest information. You need an update from someone, so you know what everyone else knows. For example: “What’s the latest news on the company’s decision?” “Sit down.

			<p class="description">If you’re a busy person, your schedule is probably full a lot of the time. With that in mind, you have to find specific periods of time to “fit” people and things into your life. Here are two examples: “I can fit you into my schedule on Tuesday afternoon”; “Find time to fit in what you love into each day.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “fit [someone] into one’s schedule,” “fit [someone] into one’s calendar,” “fit [someone] in tomorrow/on Monday/next week/etc.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">Fitting in is all about space. In this case, we are talking about physically or figuratively fitting in. How much stuff can you fit into your bag? How many people can you fit into your life? These are the ideas behind this meaning. This phrasal verb is often used as “fit into.”</p>

			<p class="description">“Let’s follow up with each other next week.” This means we will speak again next week to give each other new information. When you follow up with someone, you contact them about a topic you have previously discussed.</p>
			<p class="description">In the sales industry, it is common for businesses to follow up with a potential customer if the customer showed some interest in a product but hasn’t contacted the business in a few days to confirm their interest in actually purchasing the product. For example: “Do you remember Luke from last week? He seemed pretty interested in a new car, but he hasn’t returned our last call. Could you follow up with him today?” This means “Could you contact him today and ask if he’s still interested in buying a car from us?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can turn “follow up” into an adjective by hyphenating it, as in “Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment next month.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">You can follow up with someone or on something. This is similar to usage 1, but it focuses on the topic previously discussed instead of the person. For example: “We need to follow up on last week’s meeting.” This means we need to continue the discussion we started last week.

			<p class="description">If you enjoy having a cup of tea after your lunch, you can say “I usually follow up my lunch with a cup of tea.” This means I eat my lunch first, then I have my tea. This usage means that one action is followed by another action.</p>
			<p class="description">You can also follow up something you said. For example: “She said he was lazy, then followed up by calling him selfish.” In this case, first she called him lazy, and then selfish. This usage is often followed by “with” or “by.”</p>

			<p class="description">If a person gets back to you, they respond to you. We get back to someone when they are waiting for us to answer a question, make a decision, or because they would like to have a conversation with us. Sometimes, we do not get back to people immediately because we are busy or we need time to assess a situation, make a decision, or to formulate a proper response.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is often used in emails and conversational exchanges in the workplace. The 3 examples above are very common in this context. Here are 3 more common examples: “I apologize for not getting back to you sooner”; “Has he/she gotten back to you yet?”; “Please get back to me as soon as possible.” (Or, “Please get back to me at your earliest convenience” if you would like to be more polite.)</span></p>

			<p class="description">This phrase often refers to a person’s financial situation (“I make enough money to get by”), but it is used in other contexts as well. For example: “She got by with a really old computer and managed to finish her degree.” In both cases, we are concerned with doing or having enough to keep moving forward in life or in a particular area of one’s life. “Most people are just trying to get by” means “Most people are just trying to survive&mdash;to do enough to continue living.”</p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	How much money do you need to get by each week?</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Are you happy/satisfied just getting by?” (Are you okay just doing the minimum?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This is similar to the first usage, but it focuses more on the effort a person uses in his/her life. If you say “He does just enough to get by,” you mean he does not try very hard and only does the minimum he needs to do at his job, school, etc. The phrases “do just enough” and “just get by” are common in this usage. In the case of “just get by,” it is often preceded by an adjective such as happy, satisfied, content, or okay. See the examples above.</p>

			<p class="description">If someone tells you to “get on with it” in an annoyed way, they want you to continue to the next part of your speech, presentation, point, discussion, etc. People who are bored, impatient, or who think that something (a performance, a presentation, etc.) is moving too slowly might use this imperative. It can also be used if you feel someone or something is taking too long. For example: “We have been waiting to start this meeting for fifteen minutes.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Get with it.” (Become engaged with the present moment. Focus on what is being discussed, done, etc. Join us here!)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase has a couple of common uses: “Get with it” and “Get with the times.” “Get with it” means that your mind is not properly engaged with what we are doing or discussing. For example, if someone is playing basketball, but they seem distracted and are playing poorly, one of their teammates might say “Get with it!” to mean “Focus on what you’re doing! Join us here in the present! Engage with what is actually happening directly in front of you!” The sentence “Get with the program” has a similar meaning in this case. It says “Pay attention to what everyone else is doing. You need to do the same thing. Wake up!”</p>
			<p class="description">“Get with the times” means “You need to change your old thoughts and ways so you can understand and fit with contemporary culture.” For instance, if someone is wearing a pair of pants that stopped being fashionable 30 years ago, they might be told to “get with the times.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can separate this phrasal verb by putting an object after “get.” For instance: “You need to get your grandfather with the times.” This usage is not as common as the others listed above.</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I give up.” (I quit. I’m not going to try anymore.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you give up playing piano, you stop trying to learn it. Perhaps you lost interest, didn’t have the time, or didn’t have the money to keep practicing. In all these cases, you quit the activity. You can “give up” something voluntarily or because of outside factors. Finally, the phrase “give up” is often associated with quitting what many people consider to be bad habits or addictions, such as drinking alcohol, smoking, or doing hard drugs.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can also “give up on” something or someone. This means you stop investing your energy and hope in something or someone. For instance, “Please don’t give up on me” means “Please continue to believe in me and trust that I will not disappoint you.” You can also give up on things such as the government, a belief system, a company, a relationship, etc. For example, if you say “They gave up on their friendship,” this means they stopped believing in their friendship and stopped trying to make it work.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “give up believing in [something or someone],” “give up drinking (alcohol),” “give up smoking,” “give up trying”</span></p>

			<p class="description">Monks have to give up their possessions when they enter a monastery. If you don’t have the money to pay for your home, you might have to give your home up to the bank. A person can give up their rights to something (”Never give up your right to free speech”). In all of these cases, someone is forced to give something without a choice. However, you can give up something voluntarily. For instance, a soldier can choose to give up their life for a noble cause.</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “We went by __________.” (We passed that location.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase means to move or pass by someone or something. If you take the bus in the city, the bus will go by many cars, buildings, etc. Abstract ideas such as time can also go by.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The phrase “pass by” is used more often to mean “We stopped at that location then continued our journey” than “go by.” For example: “Could we pass by the bank before we go to the store?” This means “Could we make a quick stop at the bank before we go to the store?” You can also use the phrase “stop by” in this case. The phrase “go by” typically means to continue moving past a person or place without stopping, though it can be clarified in a situation such as this one: “We went by your place to see if you were home, but the lights were off, so we kept driving.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">If your company has policies that you must follow, you must go by those policies&mdash;you must base your actions and decisions on them because if you don’t go by the rules, you might lose your job. You can also go by a person’s words, which means you accept their words and base your decisions on them. “Hey, don’t be mad. I was just going by your advice,” for example. This means you acted by following your friend’s or colleague’s advice.</p>

			<p class="description">What name do you go by? What you go by is what you want people to call you. For example: “Her full name is Lucinda, but she goes by Lu.” In most cases, we use this phrase to talk about people’s names, but it can be used to talk about the names of places as well. For example: “Didn’t that company go by a different name before?” However, this usage is inconsistent, so it’s usually safer to just say “Didn’t that company have a different name before?”</p>
			<p class="description">If you have different online identities, you can use this phrase as well. For example: “She goes by SuperGirl47 on social media.” A person can go by many names in many different places.</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It went on for __________.” (It continued for this many seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If someone simply says “Go on,” they mean “Continue.” Perhaps they want to hear what you have to say, or they want you to continue doing an activity. “How long did it go on for?” means “How long did it continue or proceed for?” Another common question with this phrase is “How long has this/it been going on for?” This means “How long has this been happening or continuing for?” You can also go on doing an activity. For instance: “He went on driving until he reached his destination.”</p>
			<p class="description">If someone “goes on talking,” the meaning can be neutral, but it can also mean they talk excessively. In this case, you could say “He went on and on.” This means he continued talking for a long time in a way that was perhaps annoying or frustrating for his listeners. The emphatic phrase “go on and on” can refer to continuing an activity for an extended period of time.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “go on and on,” “go on for (a duration of time),” “go on talking,” “go on trying,” “go on until (a particular time),” “life goes on”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He/She/They went on to __________.” (This is what they did or became in the future.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you finish one task and continue to another task, you “go on to the next task.” For example: “After I had my lunch, I went on to my work”; “I went on to finish my work.” This is the immediate future usage of this phrase. It can have a longer time meaning. For example: “Do you remember Jenna from elementary school? Did you know she went on to become an opera singer?” This means I learned that Jenna became an opera singer when she grew older. You can set goals for yourself with this phrase by saying something such as: “I want to go on to become a writer.” This is what I want to do in the future.</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “What does that have to do with it?” (What is the relationship between what you said and what we are discussing?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“What does this have to do with me?” You might ask this if you want to know how a discussion relates to you or how it concerns you. The phrase “have to do with” cannot be taken apart and understood by its individual words. You can try to replace it in your mind with words and phrases like “about,” “related to,” or “concerned with.” For example: “The movie has to do with life in Tibet.” This means the movie is about life in Tibet in some way.</p>
			<p class="description">We often use this phrase when we do not have the exact details of something. For example: “I haven’t read the book, but I know it has to do with stoic philosophy.” Another adjacent example of this usage might be: “I don’t know what they’re talking about, but I think it has to do with you.”</p>
			<p class="description">Here is a more advanced usage: “Our decision has to do with the fact that we need to spend less money.” This means our decision is related to the fact that we need to spend less money. This can be one of many factors in our decision, or the only factor.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> In affirmative sentences, this phrase is often used with the third person subject “it.” For instance: “It has to do with money.” The determiners “This” and “That” are also commonly used. “This has to do with your brother,” for instance, meaning “This is about your brother.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">In many situations, this is mostly a different way to say the word “hold.” You can hold on to a baseball bat, a person’s hand, or a ball. If you are on a boat with your family and the waves are strong, you might hear someone say “Hold on to your mother.” In a slightly different case, if you are entrusted with keeping someone’s laptop safe and secure while they are on vacation, you are also “holding on” to that person’s laptop until they return.</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Hold on a little longer.” (Keep trying and persevering for a little longer. Don’t quit. It’s almost finished.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Holding on to something requires energy and effort. In the same way, holding on to achieve a desired result also requires energy and effort. In this case, it means to persevere and to keep going despite difficulties. Ultimately, you are successful! For example: “I’m holding on as long as I can.” This means I’m trying to maintain the condition I need in order to be successful, but it requires continued energy and effort. This usage is often used in sports and athletic competitions, as in example 1 above.</p>
			<p class="description">If you are inspired by someone to keep persevering, you can hold on for them. You are holding on for their benefit in this case. See example 3 for this usage.</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I really need to hone in on this.” (I really need to focus on this. This can be said because you want someone to leave you alone so you can focus on your work, or to remind yourself of your goal.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“Hone” is a slightly formal synonym for “sharpen.” If you hone in on something, you sharpen your focus and give all your attention to that one thing. A teacher might say the following to a student: “Your essay is good, but I want you to hone in on your second point and provide more details.” This phrasal verb is often used in military contexts to talk about honing in on a target. “We are honing in on the enemy base,” for example. This means we are getting closer to our target/focus, which is the enemy base.</p>

			<p class="description">If you keep something in mind, you remember it so you can use it later. This phrase is sometimes used as a warning by the speaker to say “Don’t forget,” or “The next thing I say is very important and relevant to the situation.” For example: “I want to ask the boss for a raise.” “I think that’s a great idea because you deserve a raise, but keep in mind that the boss has already given three people raises this week. It’s probably a better idea to wait.”</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is often used when we are giving advice, a suggestion, or information to someone.

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>to place part of one’s body’s weight on something or someone for support<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variation:</span> “lean against [something or someone]”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Don’t lean on that.”</span></p>
			<p class="description">“To lean” means to rest or place part of your body weight on or against something or someone. In the case of “lean on,” you are typically putting your weight on top of something or someone for support, though this preposition is also used in cases where you are leaning vertically against something as well. In everyday speech, “He’s leaning on the wall” can have the same meaning as “He’s leaning against the wall,” for instance.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> For the verb “lean,” you can also “lean back,” “lean forward,” or “lean to the side.” For example, if you take a relaxed posture while you are sitting in a chair, you are leaning back in your seat. A parent or teacher might say “Don’t lean back in your chair” to a child if the child has pushed their chair back on two legs and might be in danger of falling backwards.</span></p>

			<p class="description">If you lean on someone, you trust them and rely on them for something. Sometimes, it is not fair to lean on someone too much because they can get tired, stressed, or frustrated if we expect them to handle too much. We can also invite someone to lean on us if we want to help them. “I know a lot of people are sick this week, so you can lean on me more for a few days.”</p>
			<p class="description">Imagine that the person who is being leaned on is like a piece of wood that is supporting a house; they can help support the house for a few days, but eventually, the house needs other measures of support. In the same way, we should only want to lean on someone for a short period of time unless we feel they can handle the tasks given to them for a long period of time, or we don’t have a choice. For example: “My wife starts work early in the morning, so my family leans on me to prepare breakfast and to drive the kids to school every day.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “lean on [someone] for advice,” “lean on [someone] for help,” “lean on [someone] for support”</span></p>

We all lean on certain behaviours to try to achieve a desired result. If you have a job interview, you will probably lean on your past work experience and/or your personality to make a good impression on your interviewer.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Let him/her/them in.” (Allow them to enter.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“In” and “into” are often interchangeable in people’s minds when they use the common extension listed above. To specify, “Let me in the house!” and “Let me into the house!” are both possible and are both used. Technically, “in” means to be present inside the house (“I don’t want to be outside! I want to be inside!”). “Into” refers to the action of crossing a line from one place to another, in this case crossing the line (the door) between the outside and inside parts of the house.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Let [someone] in” is preferred when an adverb of place, such as “here” or “there,” is used. See example 1 above.</span></p>

			<p class="description">The idea behind this phrase is that you let people into your life and your heart&mdash;you allow them to see who you truly are on the inside. People can have a hard time letting others in. This means it’s difficult for them to talk about their most intimate thoughts and feelings with other people. If someone doesn’t want to let you in, they might be a private person, or they might be afraid of becoming close with others. They might also require more time before they feel comfortable opening up to you.</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Don’t let on that anything’s wrong.” (Don’t give any indications that something is wrong.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase can be used in the affirmative, but it is also often used in the negative. For example: “He’s not letting on that he’s upset.” This means he is not providing any indications or signs that he is upset; he appears to be fine despite what other people have said about his mood. This phrase is also often used in negative imperatives, such as “Don’t let on that anything is wrong.” This means “Don’t give any indications to other people that anything is wrong. Act like everything is okay.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Let on” is often followed by a “that” clause.

			<p class="description">This usage simply means paying attention to something you can hear. This is usually a person’s words (”Are you listening to me?” “Yes, I’m listening to you”), but it can be a song, an online video, a news report, or anything that requires the ability to hear and follow speech or other sounds, such as music or the sound of running water. </p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Don’t listen to him/her/them.” (Do not follow or believe what they say.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Listening requires active attention with your ears and your mind. Parents might ask their children, “Are you listening to me?” or “Have you heard a single word I’ve said?”. The verb “hear” refers to the physical ability to receive sound by your ear, but it can sometimes be used in a similar sense to “listen,” as in the example above. In that example, if a child chooses to ignore what their parents say, it can be said that they “don’t hear” what their parents say. It can also be said that they “don’t listen” to their parents.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> While the verb “hear” doesn’t require a preposition when you want to follow it with an object (“I heard you”), the verb “listen” does (“She doesn’t listen to her mom”).</span></p>

			<p class="description">If you have a laptop computer that requires a username and a password to access, you need to log in before you can start using your laptop’s operating system. It’s the same for any online account. For example: “You have to create an account to log in to that site.” Because we spend time on the internet and work on computers, this phrase can also be interchanged with “log on” in most cases (or “log on to” for transitive usage).</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Use “log in to” or “log into” for transitive usage. Both are accepted in speech and in writing, though “ log in to” is still seen as more correct.

We need to move on.” (We need to continue moving forward towards our goal/destination.)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Let’s move on.” (Let’s continue to the next location, the next point, the next stage, etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase can be used with physical distances and locations (ex: “We moved on from my friend’s house to the coffee shop”) or figurative distances in conversations, presentations, meetings, etc. For instance: “Next, I would like to move on to discussing last month’s sales report.” In both cases, the idea of continuing from one stage of something to next is present. If you say “Let’s move on” during a meeting, you are concerned about the length of the meeting, or you feel the current topic has been adequately discussed. “We have to move on” is a clear indication that time is an issue.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Often extended as “move on with” or “move on to” for transitive usage. For example: “Move on with the meeting”; “Move on to the next point.” This is also a case where “to” is followed by a gerund if you wish to mention an activity (“We moved on to talking about her birthday”).</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “You need to move on.” (It’s not healthy for you to continue thinking about this. You need to accept what happened, release your anger/pain/etc., and continue with your life.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you have experienced the end of an important relationship, you know how difficult it can be to continue with your life. There are personal events that make us feel like life is impossible or that it is very difficult. The phrase “move on” can help us in these cases. It can refer to any difficult situation that you continue to focus on even when it’s not healthy for you. For example: “They fired you. Don’t hold on to your anger. Move on.”</p>
			<p class="description">When we talk about “moving on,” we usually talk about something that happened in the past and our need to “move on” from it&mdash;to continue living our life in the present. This is not always easy, especially if we are dealing with serious emotional trauma and/or something like a natural disaster, as in example 2 above. In all of these cases, however, we must still try to move on and to focus on doing what we need to do next in our lives.</p>

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">idiomatic phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>to end a relationship</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“It wasn’t working, so we parted ways.”<br class="calibre6" />“Don’t part ways if you think there is a chance he still loves you.”<br class="calibre6" />“We had to part ways after she moved away for school.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “We parted ways.” (We ended our relationship.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This is a polite way to say you ended a relationship. If you part ways with someone, one person goes one way, and the other person goes another way. You “part” (or “separate”) and go in different directions. “We parted ways” sounds more poetic and somber than the more informal “We broke up.” If you part ways, it’s possible the end of the relationship was mutual and/or sad and difficult for both of you.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can “part on good terms” or “part on bad terms” with someone. This means the parting had either positive or negative emotions at the end. If you parted on bad terms with someone, there were likely hurt and/or angry feelings involved at the end of the relationship.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> For transitive usage, use “part ways with,” as in “She parted ways with Henry.” You can also simply say “They parted ways.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “break up [with someone],” “part on bad/good terms”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I must part ways with you here.” (A performative way to say goodbye to someone.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This refers to a physical separation of two or more people. It is polite and can sound slightly formal to some people, but it can be neutral as well, as in the examples above. It is sometimes said in a joking way, as if you are giving a dramatic performance. To illustrate: “I had a lovely time, but I must part ways with you now. I bid you adieu.” “I bid you adieu” is another formal sentence meaning “I wish you goodbye,” but it is often said in a joking or flippant way. If you want to be very dramatic and comedic, you could bow as you say this.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> For transitive usage, use “part ways with,” as in “I have to part ways with you here.” If you want to indicate the place where you part ways, use the appropriate preposition after “part ways.” “At” is very common in this case, as in “We parted ways at the train station.”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “She passed on peacefully.” (She died without pain.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“He passed on” is a softer way to say “He died.” While this phrase is similar to “pass away,” the received meaning is slightly different. The phrase “pass on” is linked to a belief in an afterlife&mdash;the belief that a person’s life (or their soul/spirit) continues living in a different plane of existence after their physical body dies in the mortal world. The phrase “pass away” is also a softer way of saying “die,” but if you say, “He passed away,” the meaning is closer to “He died and is not here anymore,” versus “He passed on,” which is closer to “He died and is continuing his journey in the afterlife.” The sentence “He’s/She’s/They’re in a better place” is also common among people who believe in an afterlife.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The noun form of “pass” in this context is “passing.” We can talk about someone’s death or “someone’s passing.” For example, “Did you hear about Diana’s passing?” or “Have you heard about Diana’s passing?” are common, soft ways to ask if someone has heard about a person’s death.</span></p>

			<p class="description">A teacher passes on their knowledge to their students. A parent can pass on a secret family recipe to his/her children. A friend can pass on a valuable object to another friend. The idea behind this usage is that someone is giving something to someone else. Often, this usage relies on things being transferred from one generation to the next (parents to children), but it can be used in other situations, as mentioned above. In all of these cases, the thing that is being passed on usually has real or sentimental value to the person who is giving it. You can also use this phrasal verb as a substitute for “pass.” (Ex: “Take a copy of this document and pass the others on to your classmates.”)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The phrase “pass down” is similar, but its received meaning has a direct link to time and different generations of people. “This was passed down to me by my grandmother” means my grandmother had it first and passed it “down” the family line to me.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “pass on a book/other object that has meaning to the person giving it,” “pass on a family secret/recipe/story/etc.,” “pass on everything one knows,” “pass on one’s knowledge,” “pass something on to [someone]” </span></p>

			<p class="description">“I’m going to pass on dinner” means “I am not going to have dinner.” You can pass on invitations, requests, or offers. For example: “Do you want to come to the zoo with us tomorrow?” “No, thanks. I’ll pass.” This is an informal response, and you have to be careful who you say it to, and how you say it because it can sound a little rude. In the most recent example, the received meaning could be “I have better things to do” or “I have no interest in going to the zoo.” If you keep a neutral and respectful tone, however, this phrase can just feel like a casual “No.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “pass on an invitation,” “pass on an offer,” “pass on it/that,” “pass on a request”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Pick it up.” (Lift it. Perhaps the person saying this is not happy with the mess you have made by leaving something on the floor.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Typically, we pick up (or, “lift”) something from the ground, but it can be from any surface. For example: “Pick up your backpack, please. It shouldn’t be on your bed.” We can also pick up people. For example, a small child might say “Mama! Pick me up! I want to touch the ceiling!” If someone asks you to pick up your things because they are on various surfaces in a room, the person is asking you to take your things from all of the surfaces in the room to make the room tidy.</p>

For example: “I’m going to pick up Mike at his house, and then we’re going to go to the movie theatre.” You can also use this phrasal verb to talk about obtaining objects from specific places. This is often used when talking about buying things at a store. For example: “I need to pick up some tomatoes from the market.” If you go to a person’s house to acquire something from them, you can also use this phrasal verb, as in “After school, I went to my aunt’s house to pick up a cake.”</p>

			<p class="description">If you learned piano while you were in high school, you can say “I picked up piano in high school.” This means you learned it&mdash;you acquired the skill of playing piano. This usage is common when talking about learning instruments and languages, but it can be used with other skills as well. For example, if you get a new phone and you don’t know how to use it, a friend of yours might say, “Don’t worry. I’m sure you’ll pick it up in a few days.” This means “I’m sure you’ll learn how to use it in a few days.”</p>

			<p class="description">If you try to pick someone up at a social event, a dance club, or other location where people gather, you try to get them interested in you as a romantic partner. Someone’s goal in this situation is usually to persuade the other person to give them his/her phone number. The goal of this practice is usually to have casual romantic or sexual encounters, but it can be for serious relationships as well. If your friend asks you, “Who’s Paul?” and you say “He’s the guy I picked up at my cousin’s wedding,” the received meaning is that the person who picked up Paul isn’t very serious about him, but that they will probably date him and see what happens.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “pick [someone] up at the club/the bar/the disco/the theatre/etc.,” “pick up boys,” “pick up girls,” “try to pick [someone] up” </span></p>

			<p class="description">What’s the difference between an illness and a disease? An illness needs to be managed until your body fights it and returns to a normal state (a cold, a flu, etc.). A disease needs to be cured (malaria, Ebola, etc.).</p>

If I finish my work, we can meet for coffee, but it’s possible I will have too much work and we won’t be able to meet for coffee.” Just like a musician improvises with their instrument, people improvise when they act or when they make plans. It’s similar to saying “Let’s see what happens.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> While the most common idiom is “play it by ear,” the “it” is sometimes replaced with “everything” or “the situation,” as in, “It’s obvious that she doesn’t have a plan.

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>to cheer for someone or something; to show support for someone or something with one’s voice, actions, etc.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“This is such a good game! I don’t know who to root for!”<br class="calibre6" />“Good luck on your test today. I’ll be rooting for you.”<br class="calibre6" />“Sorry that your team lost. I was really rooting for you guys.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m rooting for you.” (I want you to be successful and I want you to know you have my support and my wishes for your success.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Sports fans root for their favourite teams and players. Friends root for their friends to be successful. In both cases, someone shows vocal support for someone or something. This phrasal verb is most often associated with sports, as in, “They’ve been rooting for Chelsea since they were kids,” which means they have been supporting (or, “cheering for”) Manchester United since they were kids.</p>
			<p class="description">This phrasal verb can be used in other cases as well. For example, if you want a romantic relationship between two of your friends to be successful, you can say “I’m rooting for you guys,” which means “I support you and strongly hope that you stay together as a couple.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “nobody to root for,” “root for the home team”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>to remove something or someone from consideration; not to consider something or someone as a possible explanation or cause of something</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Do you think Erika could have done this?” “I wouldn’t rule it out.”<br class="calibre6" />“The police have ruled out revenge as a motive for the criminal’s actions.”<br class="calibre6" />“That explanation sounds a little unbelievable, but I’m not ruling it out.”<br class="calibre6" />Common sentence: “I’m not ruling it out.” (I’m not removing that as a possible explanation, cause, or reason.)</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is often used to talk about the possible reasons, explanations, or causes of something, and which reasons, explanations, and causes we choose to consider when we are looking for an answer. This phrasal verb is often used with modal verbs, such as can/can’t, will/won’t, would/wouldn’t, and should/shouldn’t. For example: “We can’t rule out the possibility that Zaya was responsible for this mistake.” This means we need to consider Zaya as a possibility for who caused the mistake.</p>
			<p class="description">Before we rule something or someone out, we usually go through an investigative or logical process. For instance: “Why did she decide to move to Dublin? I think we can definitely rule out money because she will be getting paid less at her new job, and the cost of living is higher where she’s going.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Another possible structure for saying “We can’t rule out the possibility that Zaya was responsible for this mistake” is “We can’t rule out Zaya as a possibility.” Remember, you can rule out something or someone.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “can rule out,” “can’t rule out,” “is/was ruled out,” “not ruling it out,” “rule it out,” “rule out an explanation,” “rule out as a possibility,” “rule out the possibility,” “rule [someone] out” </span></p>

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">phrasal verb (transitive, inseparable)</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>to use something as the source of something’s or someone’s energy</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Did you know that some cars can run on vegetable oil?”<br class="calibre6" />“Rockets run on jet fuel.”<br class="calibre6" />“Does it run on batteries or electricity?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It runs on batteries.” (It needs batteries to work; it uses batteries as the source of its power/energy.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Today’s cars run on fuel, electricity, or solar power. Cellphones run on batteries. Many toys run on batteries, too. When we say that something “runs on” something else, we mean it uses something as its source of energy. You can get creative (and funny) with this phrase and talk about what gives a person their energy. For example: “He runs on coffee and dreams”; “I run on pizza and soda”; “She runs on love and optimism.” In all of these cases, we mean that these people get their energy from the mentioned sources. As you can see, they can be things such as food and drink, or more abstract things, such as dreams and love.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrasal verb is usually used in the present simple (“It runs on batteries”) or the present continuous (“She’s running on a thirst for justice”). However, other tenses are also possible, such as, “Their company thinks that all cars in the future will run on solar power.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “run on (a particular emotion or abstract idea),” “run on (a specific food and/or drink),” “run on a hope and a prayer,” “run on batteries,” “run on electricity,” “run on fumes,” “run on gas/fuel/petrol,” “run on hope,” “run on solar power,” “run on the belief that…,” “run on the idea that…” </span></p>

Jane, could you help shed some light on this?”<br class="calibre6" />“This is complex topic, so give me a minute to shed some more light on it.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Could you shed some light on this?” (Could you help explain this and make it clearer for me/everyone?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you shed light on something, you try to make it clearer for others. You try to provide information that helps explain something. For example: “The presentation shed light on climate change.” This means the presentation provided more information on climate change and made it easier to understand. This phrase is often used in the question form “Could you shed some light on...,” as in “Could you shed some light on this situation?” In this case, the person is asking you to help explain the situation in more detail because you probably know something about it.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “help (to) shed light on something,” “shed light on a situation,” “shed light on a subject,” “shed light on a topic,” “shed light on it/this/that,” “shed light on the fact that…,” “shed more light on something”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Who are you siding with?” (Who are you going to support and/or agree with in this situation?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">You can side with someone in an argument. For example, if your mother and father are having a debate, you can choose to side with your mother or to side with your father, depending on whom you agree with. Another way to say this is that you are “on someone’s side.” In the situation above, you can say “I’m on my mom’s side in this case,” or “I’m siding with my mom in this case.” You can side with someone’s opinion, beliefs, reasons for doing something, or their actions. The opposite of this phrase is to side against someone, as in “His own brother sided against him.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase can be used in most tenses, but is often used in the past simple (“She sided with the enemy”), the present simple (“Don’t side with him”), or the present continuous when you make a decision in the moment or you are temporarily picking one side to support (“We’re siding with the company for now”). This phrase is also sometimes used in conditional sentences, as in this third conditional example: “I would have sided with them if they hadn’t fired 200 employees.”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He’s/She’s signed on for another ______ months/years/etc.” (He/She has this much time remaining on their contract.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you sign on with a company, you usually sign your name on an official contract. Signing on with a company means that you have an agreement with them, whether permanent or for a specific period of time. This phrasal verb is often used in sports, as in “She signed on with the team for another four seasons.” A company or organization can also sign someone on, as in “They signed me on for a summer position.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “sign on for (a specific period of time),” “sign on with [someone] (a company, organization, team, etc.)”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I signed up.” (I officially registered or volunteered.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“Have you signed up yet?” This means “Have you signed your name to officially join the activity, presentation, course, club, etc. yet?” You can sign up for a gym membership, an email list, or a social gathering, among many other things. Parents often sign their children up for activities. For example: “I signed up my son for taekwondo classes”; “My mom signed me up for summer camp.”</p>

The spy just slipped by the guards.”<br class="calibre6" />“I’ll let it slip by this time, but make sure you’re never late again.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I let it slip by.” (I let it pass, either consciously or because I missed it.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If someone slips by you while you’re standing on the bus, they do their best to pass you without touching you and without being noticed. They might even say, “Excuse me. Can I slip by?” This is similar to the phrase “pass by,” but it has an element of stealth attached to it. Imagine a person who makes themselves as thin and quiet as possible when they are trying to move through a tight space.</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase can be used in a variety of contexts. For example: “Many of his jokes slipped by me.” “It’s already 5 o’clock? The day just slipped by.” “I can’t believe that policy slipped by and was included in the final document.” In all of these cases, something passes something or someone. In the third example, just like a spy can quietly slip by a security guard, a policy can slip by an approval process and get into (or, “slip into”) an official document.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> An opportunity can “slip you by” or “slip by.” This means you do not take advantage of it quickly enough, or you choose to ignore it. For example: “You could have had that position, but you didn’t file an application, so you just let the opportunity slip you by.” (Or, “slip by.”)</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “let an opportunity slip (you) by,” “let it/him/her slip by,” “slipped by quietly,” “slip by undetected,” “slip by without being noticed”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>to wait in readiness for someone or something; to wait and be ready to help and/or take action; to wait and do nothing</p>

Please stand by for his official address to the nation.”<br class="calibre6" />“The soldiers are standing by and waiting to receive their orders.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Are you just going to stand by and do nothing?” (Are you just going to allow this to happen by not taking any action?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is common in official contexts, such as in military and government orders, or during news reports. For example: “The president says the army is ready and standing by”; “Please stand by for further details”; “We now take you to our field reporter, Joanna Mackinson, who is standing by at the site of the accident.” In all of these cases, someone is waiting and doing nothing, but they are ready to act when needed.</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is also often used in the context of scolding someone for not acting during an important moment. Two common sentences with this usage are: “We can’t just stand by and let this happen,” and “Are you going to stand by and do nothing?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “can’t just stand by,” “stand by and do nothing,” “stand by and let something happen,” “stand by for details,” “stand by for further instructions,” “stand by until further notice,” “standing by and ready for action,” “standing by and ready to go”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I stand by what I said.” (I am not changing my opinion. I still believe and support what I said.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">We often stand by our friends when they are going through a difficult time, or when they are the objects of criticism, unpopularity, or ridicule. Our friends need us during these times because they might feel scared or anxious. When we stand by them, we offer them continued support. We might not even agree with our friends, and we might think they deserve the criticism they are receiving, but we still choose to stand by them.</p>
			<p class="description">You can also stand by something you say or believe, as in example 3 above. This means you still believe and support your own words, beliefs, etc. When we choose to stand by someone or something we say or believe, we can also become objects of criticism, unpopularity, or ridicule.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “stand by one’s words/beliefs/opinions,” “stand by [someone], no matter what,” “stand by what one says/believes,” “stand by you/me/etc.”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Stay away from him/her/them.” (Keep your distance from him/her/them. This can be literal because the person is sick, for instance, or advice not to interact or become involved with someone.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“You should stay away from social media.” This means you should avoid social media. The phrase “stay away” is often used in sentences that give advice, such as in the example above, but it can be used in practical contexts as well. For instance: “I try to stay away from eating dairy because it upsets my stomach”; “I couldn’t stay away from him.” In the second example, perhaps the person was really in love with someone, or they had an unhealthy relationship with someone.</p>
			<p class="description">If something is everywhere and/or unavoidable, you can also say “You can’t stay away from it,” or “You can’t stay away from it forever.” You can also “try to stay away” from someone or something, such as drinking, overeating, sweets, watching the news, etc. In all of these cases, we are talking about avoiding or not going near someone or something.</p>

			<p class="description">Everything has a source, or something it stems from. A flower stem is the long green part you hold between your fingers when you pull or cut a flower from the ground. The stem grows and comes from the ground before it blooms at the very top and becomes a full flower. In the same way, our beliefs can stem from various sources, such as our parents, our schooling, our independent reading, and/or our friends. We don’t typically talk about people stemming from somewhere (as we do with “come from”), but about concrete and abstract things. For example, our problems often stem from something, as do our beliefs and opinions.</p>

			<p class="description">If you decide to buy a new phone, and you choose to buy one that is the same brand as the phone you currently use, you are choosing to stick with that brand. This means you are not changing the brand of your phone. When we stick with something, it’s usually because we have had positive experiences with it in the past.</p>
			<p class="description">This phrasal verb is very common when we are talking about the brands and types of things we use and/or choose. For example, a waiter at a restaurant that you often visit might ask, “Would you like to try something new tonight, or will you stick with your usual order?”</p>
			<p class="description">You can also stick with a type of exercise (“My friend told me to try karate, but I’m going to stick with yoga”), a particular career field (“She has decided to stick with content marketing”), or a particular way of doing things (“I’m going to stick with doing things my way!”).</p>
			<p class="description">Sometimes, we stick with things because of habit. For instance: “I’ve stuck with my internet provider for 10 years. I don’t want to deal with changing everything now.” Finally, we stick with things because they have worked for us in the past: “Stick with what works!”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Stick with me.” (Stay close to me physically, or stay close to me and do not abandon me over a period of time.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“I have stuck with my husband for 20 years.” This means the person has continued being with their husband for 20 years. This is similar to usage 1, but it uses people (or animals and pets) instead of things. The passive form is also common with “stick with,” as in “My brother went on vacation, so I have been stuck with his dog for the past 7 days.”</p>
			<p class="description">If someone is very loyal and stays with someone else until the end of a significant period of time, a common usage of this phrase is “stick with someone until the end,” as in “His wife passed away last year. He stuck with her until the end.”</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase can also mean that you are simply physically close to someone, as in this example: “Make sure to stick with me when we’re walking through the airport. It’s easy to get lost.” A similar phrase for this situation is “stick close to someone.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “stick with me,” “stick with the group,” “be stuck with [someone],” “stick with [someone] until the end”</span></p>

Just stick with it.”<br class="calibre6" />“Learning an instrument is hard, but if you stick with it, it’s very rewarding.”<br class="calibre6" />“If you stick with English and push yourself to study every day, I promise you will see significant results in just a few months.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Stick with it!” (Stay with it. Continue trying. Do not become discouraged, and do not quit.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“Stick with it!” is the most common imperative you will hear with this usage. It means to continue doing the activity you are doing and not to stop or quit. The person who is encouraging you probably sees your talent and the hard work you have already done, so they want you to continue moving forward. For example: “This math question is really hard.” “You did the ones before it, right? Stick with it.” You can imagine that this phrase means to stay with the problem longer and continue trying to solve it. Don’t give up! Keep at it! Stick with it! You can do it!</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “That has always stuck with me.” (That left an impression on me and I still remember it and think about it today.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Someone’s words, a movie, a song, a particular memory, or anything that leaves a strong impression on you can stick with you. This means it stays with you and is not easily forgotten. For example: “That movie has stuck with me.” This means the movie has stayed in your memories. This is probably because the themes and messages of the movie feel important to you and speak to your heart, mind, and/or spirit. Feelings and emotions can stick with us, too. For example: “The anger she felt toward her father stuck with her for a long time.”</p>
			<p class="description">Finally, if you see a positive change in someone’s behaviour, you can say “I hope it sticks,” meaning “I hope he/she continues to act in this way,” or “I hope this person’s new and improved behaviour becomes permanent.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase can be used in various tenses, but is often used with the present perfect and the past simple.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He/She swears by it.” (He/She uses it regularly and trusts that it is effective.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“I swear by it!” This is the most common sentence that uses this phrase. It means “I use this all the time, and I promise you that it is effective.” The “it” can be any product, tool, service, or object that the person trusts. For example, a friend might tell you: “My mother swears by honey and ginger tea as a cure for a cold.” However, while these descriptive sentences are certainly possible and do happen in regular conversation, this phrase is typically used in these quick spoken confirmations: “He/She swears by it” or “I swear by it.” You can also use the plural “them” for plural objects, as in “He/She swears by them” or “I swear by them.”</p>
			<p class="description">We can also swear by specific physical remedies, foods, drinks, or even restaurants. For example: “Can you recommend a good pizza place?” “I swear by Gino’s Pizzeria.” This means “I have been to Gino’s Pizzeria numerous times, and I am telling you that it is a great pizza place.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “swear by it,” “swear by [something] as a remedy for [something],” “swear by [something] as the best way to…”</span></p>

			<p class="description">In most cases, you can replace the phrase “take someone or something by surprise” with “surprise someone or something,” and the meaning will be the same. For instance, “Your decision really took the company by surprise” is another way of saying “Your decision really surprised the company.” This is simply another way to say something, and it adds variety to your language. The word “take” gives a more physical feeling to the surprise, like someone grabbing you by your shirt and saying “surprise!”</p>

			<p class="description">If the police plan a secret operation and hope to surprise a gang of criminals, they plan to take them by surprise. For example: “We’ll take the west compound by surprise. They won’t see us coming.” In this situation, the police are using surprise as a tactical strategy. They are using surprise as a weapon. This usage is common in military and law enforcement contexts, but it can be used in contexts that involve regular citizens as well, as in “He took me by surprise and demanded that I give him all of my money.”</p>

			<p class="description">If you’re planning a party and assigning different responsibilities to people, the people are responsible for taking care of their tasks. For example, “Dan’s going to take care of the drinks” means that Dan will buy the drinks. If you have a family and your partner says “I’ll take care of dinner tonight,” this means they will take responsibility for preparing dinner.</p>
			<p class="description">“I took care of it” and “I’ll take care of it” are very common sentences with this usage. They mean “I handled it” or “I will handle it.” In all of these cases, someone is responsible for managing something.</p>

			<p class="description">Parents are responsible for taking care of their children. This means they feed them, provide them with clothing and shelter, and give them the emotional support they require. The phrase can be used in any situation where someone is responsible for the well-being, safety, and/or condition of someone or something. For example, a teacher must take care of his/her students while the students are at school. A trainer at a job is responsible for taking care of new employees, and someone who works with clients or customers is responsible for taking care of their clients or customers.</p>
			<p class="description">You can also take care of things and places. This means you keep them in good condition. For instance, “He takes care of his car” means “He keeps his car in good condition.” He probably washes it and takes it to the mechanic on a regular basis. A person can also take care of their home, which means they clean it and keep the house in good condition.</p>

			<p class="description">The word “granted” in this idiom means “given,” as in “take someone or something as a given.” This means things and people are freely given and they are expected to do certain things and/or act in certain ways without any expectation of gratitude or appreciation in return.</p>
			<p class="description">A romantic partner who expects you to always cook and clean for them, but who never says “thank you” for these things, might be taking you for granted. When we simply expect people to do certain things for us, or when we ignore their physical and emotional needs but still expect them to continue doing things for us, we take them for granted. For example, a friend might tell you the following: “You cooked and cleaned for him, you took care of the kids, and you even bought presents for his parents’ birthdays because he forgot about them, and he still complained and never showed any gratitude. He took you for granted.”</p>
			<p class="description">We can take things (both tangible and intangible) for granted as well. For instance: “Don’t take her kindness for granted”’; “You’re taking your car for granted”; “I took my last job for granted.” In all of these cases, the idea of placing value on things and appreciating that value is present.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This idiom is often used in the past simple (ex: “I took you for granted”). It is also common to hear it used in warnings and advice. For instance: “You shouldn’t take him for granted”; “Don’t take her for granted”; “You can’t take this opportunity for granted.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">Many suburban people take garbage collection and recycling collection services for granted. This means they have become accustomed to them, and they simply expect them to function normally all the time. Suburban home owners also take things like working toilets, electricity, hot water, and indoor heating for granted. This means they expect it because it’s a normal part of their lives. We often take things for granted when they are a frequent and reliable part of our lives. In this way, we perhaps undervalue these things.</p>
			<p class="description">To provide another example, people in many developed and developing countries take paved roads for granted. If a road is not smooth, a person might express their displeasure because they simply expect roads to be paved and smooth. Another way to say this is that people “take paved roads as a given.”</p>
			<p class="description">If we are debating with someone and we accept that something is true without questioning it, we are taking it for granted. Your debate partner might say something like this: “I think you’re taking for granted that people are rational creatures,” which means “I think you are accepting too easily that people are rational creatures because there is a lot of evidence to suggest this is not the case.” When we make statements in which we simply accept something as true, we are taking that thing for granted.</p>

			<p class="description">When you are making a decision, you need to consider many factors and decide how they will affect the final outcome. For instance: “We want to have a picnic tomorrow, but we need to take the weather into account.” This means we need to consider the weather in our discussion and final decision about the picnic. You can take a person into account, as in this example: “If we invite Marissa to dinner this weekend, we need to take Leo into account. Marissa just broke up with him a couple of days ago.” This means we need to think about Leo and how he would feel if Marissa was at the dinner party.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Take into account” is often followed by a noun clause, such as a that-clause or a Wh-clause. For example: “The restaurant took into account that not everyone eats meat”; “We have to take into account which project website is best for our purposes.” This phrase can also have a long noun phrase when using the “take something into account” structure, as in “He didn’t take the weight of his luggage into account.” Modal verbs of advice and necessity are also common with this phrase, such as “should take into account,” “have to take into account,” “must take into account,” etc.</span></p>

For example: “You’re doing a master’s degree and working full-time at the same time? That’s a lot to take on.” You can offer to take on a particular job or responsibility as well, as in “I’ll take it on” or “I can take on a little more.” Imagine physically taking work into your hand, placing it onto your back, and carrying it. You can also imagine a pile of responsibilities in front of you that grows as you say “yes” to more work and/or more responsibilities.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Take on someone your own size.” (Fight someone who is as big as you. Don’t be a bully.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">When discussing sports, the phrase “take on” is a synonym for “play against.” For example, “France took on Croatia in the 2018 World Cup Final” is the same as “France played against Croatia in the 2018 World Cup Final.” This phrase is synonymous with the idea of competition and battle. It can be used in combat sports (“Fighter A is going to take on Fighter B next month”), or to talk about fighting in any scenario. For example, “My brother could take you on” means “My brother could defeat you in a physical fight.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The verb “take” can be followed by an object to have the same meaning. For example: “Do you think you can take me?” (Do you think you can beat me in a fight?) or “I can take you” (I can beat you in a fight).</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “take on an opponent,” “take on the challenger,” “take on the champion(s),” “take [someone] on”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “We touched on a lot of things.” (We discussed a lot of different topics.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is often used in professional discussion or writing contexts, but it can be used in any context where you are addressing something. Here is a question a news reporter might ask a public company representative at a press conference: “You touched on the fact that your company lost money last quarter. What is your plan to turn this around?”</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase can also be used to talk about books, articles, and essays. For instance: “The book touches on the challenges that immigrants face in America.” This means it briefly addresses this topic. Things that are touched on are not usually explored in detail, but are discussed to some degree. You can indicate that the topic was discussed extensively by saying “It was touched on in detail.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “touch on [something] a little bit,” “touch on [something] briefly,” “touch on [something] extensively,” “touch on [something] in detail,” “touch on the fact that…”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“We used to love that show when we were kids.”<br class="calibre6" />“I used to believe in the Tooth Fairy.”<br class="calibre6" />“Where did you use to go to school?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I used to live there.” (I lived there in the past. I do not live there now.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Note these examples: “He used to be a veterinarian.” “My mom used to work there.” “I used to want to be a doctor.” “We used to have a dog.” “That store used to be a factory.” “We used to play soccer every day.” “She used to be married.” In all of these cases, something was true in the past, but is no longer true in the present.</p>
			<p class="description">Why say “I used to live there” instead of “I lived there”? “Used to” emphasizes that something is not true anymore. In this way, it can have a feeling of remembrance, loss, and/or nostalgia attached to it.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Used to” only exists in the simple past. For its negative and question forms, remember to remove the “d,” as in “He didn’t use to live here,” and “Where did he use to live?” Finally, always follow “used to” with a base verb, as in “She used to love that movie.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Used to” and “would” can both be used to talk about past habits and repeated behaviours, but “would” is more common in this context, especially if you are talking about a series of actions that you did on a regular basis. Note the following examples: “When I was a kid, I would always arrive late to school” (This was a habit of mine); “On weekends, I would wake up late, then I would watch TV and play with my friends.” “Used to” is possible in these cases to refer to the fact that this was true in the past, but “would” focuses more on the repetition of the action or behaviour.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “used to be,” “used to believe that…,” “used to go,” “used to have,” “used to listen,” “used to live,” “used to love,” “used to play,” “used to think that…,” “used to watch,” “used to work”  </span></p>

			<p class="description">By using this book, you are working on your English&mdash;you are using your time, energy, and effort to improve a skill. You can also use this phrase to mean you are trying to produce something and you are in the middle of using your time, energy, and effort on it. For instance, you can work on a project, a puzzle, a song, a movie, etc. To illustrate this further, note these examples: “Miranda has worked on 3 movies”; “Julian is working on a puzzle with his son.” “We’re working on renovating our kitchen.” Anything that requires your attention and effort to improve, handle, or produce can be worked on.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> People can work on themselves. This means they try to improve themselves and their habits.

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>with regard to; in reference to; used for changing the focus of a discussion by introducing a topic that is still related to the previous sentence</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I had coffee and a muffin for breakfast. As for lunch, I had sushi.”<br class="calibre6" />“Teachers must be present in their classrooms tomorrow morning.

			<p class="description">Use this prepositional phrase to shift the focus of your words. This phrase is typically used to introduce a subject that is related to what has already been said, as in the examples above. Here is another conversational context: “Georgia is waiting for your decision. Also, do you want to go out for lunch later?” “Tell Georgia I will make my decision before the end of the day. As for lunch, yes. I need to get out of this office today.” As you can see, this is a useful phrase when you want to shift the focus of the discussion.

			<p class="description">If someone or something causes you to be in a weaker position, they “put you at a disadvantage.” In a soccer game, if a player receives a red card, they put their team at a disadvantage. You can include statistics in this phrase to specify the degree of the disadvantage. For instance, “They’re at a 10-9 disadvantage,” which means the other team has 10 players while they have 9 players.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can say “We have a disadvantage” instead of “We’re at a disadvantage.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">This phrase is often used at the beginning of a sentence (example 1) or after a proper noun or pronoun (examples 2 and 3). The idea of judging someone or something quickly is the essence of this phrase. A glance is a quick look, so when you judge someone or something “at a glance,” you are judging them with a quick look and not evaluating them in any substantial depth.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “at a cursory glance,” “at a quick glance,” “evaluate [something or someone] at a glance,” “identify [something or someone] at a glance,” “judge [something or someone] at a glance,” “see [something or someone] at a glance”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“You need to increase the cost. Right now, you’re selling at a loss.”<br class="calibre6" />“They sold their house at a loss. It was in incredibly poor condition.”<br class="calibre6" />“She sold her book at a loss, but it was for a good cause.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He/She/They sold it at a loss.” (They lost money. They sold their product below the profit margin.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If a product sells at a loss, it costs more to make the product than it does to sell it. This means it should cost more if the producer wants to actually make money (or, “make a profit”). The two most common verbs with this phrase are “make” and “sell,” as in “They made that movie at a loss” and “Those dolls sold at a loss.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “build [something] at a loss,” “make [something] at a loss,” “produce [something] at a loss,” “sell [something] at a loss”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m at a loss.” (I don’t know what to think, say, or do about this situation, news, etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If a situation leaves you feeling uncertain about your next thought, word, or action, it leaves you at a loss. A person’s words or actions, a major news event, or a really intense experience can leave us at a loss. For example: “When I finished listening to her story, I was at a loss for words.” In this case, the story the person heard was so powerful that it stunned and/or shocked them into silence. If we hear or witness something foolish or incredible, we can also be at a loss. For instance: “You spent $500 on a t-shirt? But…How…I...I’m at a total loss here.”</p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>immediately; with no need for a warning; very quickly</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“They’re really good people. They’ll help you at a moment’s notice.”<br class="calibre6" />“If you need anything, just let me know. I’ll be there at a moment’s notice.”<br class="calibre6" />“Tell me when you’re hungry. I can have dinner ready at a moment’s notice.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I can be there at a moment’s notice.” (I can be there almost immediately. Just ask me shortly before you need me.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is used to indicate how quickly someone responds to a request. If someone says “I can be there at a moment’s notice,” it means “I can be there very quickly after you ask me.” You need someone to initiate the action. “Notice” refers to how much warning or how much time you give a person to react after you ask them if they can do something. Here is another example: “Don’t trust that phone company. They’ll increase your costs at a moment’s notice.” This means the company won’t give you a lot of warning before they increase your costs.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is often used with the modals “will” and “can,” as in “She’ll be there at a moment’s notice” and “I can be ready at a moment’s notice.”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>without movement; completely still; stuck; in a position where no one has the advantage</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I’m going to arrive late today. Traffic is at a standstill.”<br class="calibre6" />“Negotiations between the countries are currently at a standstill.”<br class="calibre6" />“The two teams seem to be at a standstill, as neither side has sustained any offensive pressure.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s/They’re at a standstill.” (It’s/They’re stuck. There is no movement. No one has an advantage.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If traffic is at a standstill, it is not moving and no single driver has an advantage over another driver. Common things that can be at a standstill include traffic, negotiations, sports matches, debates, and arguments. This means all sides are in the same position, and they are stuck unless one side concedes their position, or in the case of negotiations and arguments, compromises their position.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> A common variation of this phrase is “to a standstill,” which is often preceded by the verbs “fight,” “negotiate,” “argue,” or “play,” as in “The teams fought to a standstill,” which means the game ended in a draw. The phrase “in a standstill” is also common, and is usually preceded by the verb “end,” as in “The negotiations ended in a standstill,” which means an agreement was not reached, and neither side wanted to compromise. An argument or negotiation can also “reach a standstill,” which means it arrives at a point where all sides in the negotiation are stuck and do not want to concede or compromise their position.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “argue to a standstill,” “be at a standstill,” “end in a standstill,” “fight to a standstill,” “negotiate to a standstill,” “play to standstill,” “reach a standstill”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “One at a time, please.” (Please go in order, one person/thing/question/etc. followed by the next.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">When you eat crackers, if you regularly place three of them into your mouth and then eat them, you eat three crackers at a time. If an elevator can only fit seven people, you can say it can only fit seven people at a time. If a bank doesn’t allow more than 20 people inside its doors, it only allows 20 people at a time. As you can see, this phrase refers to how many things or people there are in one place, moment, activity, or occasion.</p>
			<p class="description">We often use this to talk about rules or expectations. For example, if someone finishes giving a presentation and everyone around them starts asking questions at the same time, the presenter might say the following: “I will address your questions one at a time.” This means the presenter will answer the questions in order and only listen to one person before continuing to the next one. They have set the expectations for everyone.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “(not) too many at a time,” “(not) too much at a time,” “one/two/three/etc. at a time”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Not at all.” (This is a standalone response meaning “Not in any way or to any degree or quantity.”)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“I didn’t like that movie at all” means “I liked nothing about that movie.” This phrase is often used in the negative, but it can be used in affirmative sentences as well, such as “Please let me know if you have any questions at all” or “Do you need any help at all?” In these cases, “at all” means “in any way or to any degree or quantity.”</p>
			<p class="description">Note the following negative examples for further contexts: “That didn’t help at all”; “That didn’t work at all”; “He was no help at all”; “The job was simple. It was no work at all.”</p>
			<p class="description">The phrase “Not at all” is also a response you can give after someone says “Thank you.” This is more common in current and former British English regions. This phrase is also a possible answer to many different scenarios, such as the following: “How was the test? Was it really hard?” “Not at all.” “Not at all” is an emphatic way to say “No” in scenarios such as this.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “any at all,” “any help at all,” “any questions at all,” “no effort at all,” “no help at all,” “no work at all,” “none at all,” “not at all”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>regardless of the resources required; used when you want to say that something is to be done regardless of the consequences or the damage it may cause</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“We need to finish this project today at all costs.”<br class="calibre6" />“They’ve been winning at all costs lately.”<br class="calibre6" />“At all costs, do not let the boss find out this happened.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Win at all costs.” (Find any way to win. Winning is the most important part of this game/competition/etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“Protect the Queen at all costs” means “Use any and all means necessary to protect the Queen regardless of the resources that might be sacrificed to protect her.” A hockey team might want to win at all costs, meaning they are willing to do anything necessary to win.</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is often used in imperatives and when discussing necessity. For instance: “Defeat them at all costs!”; “At all costs, avoid the enemy.”; “We have to do better than them at all costs.” As you can see, there is often an element of competition, battle, or secrecy with this phrase.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> While this phrase can come at the beginning of a sentence, it is usually used at the end.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “at any cost to myself/yourself/himself/etc.,” “avoid [something or someone] at all costs,” “win at all costs”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “above all else,” “at any cost”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-178"></a>at all times</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>continuously and always; without relaxing your effort or attention for any moment or period of time; without changing or stopping for any reason same in some contexts: “all the time”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“The prisoner needs to be monitored at all times.”<br class="calibre6" />“Keep your hands where I can see them at all times.”<br class="calibre6" />“You need to be cautious at all times when you’re doing this job.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Pay attention at all times.” (Do not relax your level of attention for any moment or period of time. Always pay attention.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“When I was a kid, my parents knew where I was at all times.” This means my parents always knew where I was. This is the essence of this phrase. If you are referring to or asking for continued attention, then “at all times” is the correct phrase to use. You might see this word on official warnings and instructions, such as the following: “Keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times.” “Keep your helmet on at all times.” “Please keep your luggage with you at all times.” “Keep your seatbelt on at all times.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “At all times” is not a consistent substitute for “all the time” and “always.” For example, saying “I always study in the evening” is not the same as “I study at all times in the evening.” In the first example, the person studies in the evening on a regular basis. This is their usual time to study. However, in the second example, the person studies continuously from the beginning of the evening to the end. In the “always” example, perhaps the person studies for 30 minutes per day, every day. It is unclear. Luckily, “I study at all times in the evening” is not very common at all, as the vast majority of people stick to “I always study in the evening.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be available at all times,” “be careful at all times,” “keep [something] on/with you at all times,” “pay attention at all times”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-179"></a>at any rate</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>in any case or in any event; regardless of anything else; used when you want to change or re-focus the subject, or indicate that what you said or are going to say is true, more precise, or the most important part of your statement<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “anyway”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“It was too expensive to buy, and at any rate, I didn’t really want it.”<br class="calibre6" />“That’s a big problem. At any rate, what are we going to do about it?”<br class="calibre6" />“Their performance was terrible. I thought so at any rate.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I think so at any rate.” (This is my opinion in this case.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">You can put this phrase at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence. Just like the word “anyway,” it’s used to add an extra emphasis on a particular part of your statement/thought/etc. For example: “We all agree that this is a really terrible situation. At any rate, what’s our next move?” Here, the person is changing the focus of the conversation. The most important thing they want to say and know is “What’s our next move?” When used in this way, “at any rate” means “I acknowledge everything we have just discussed, but here is what I think is the most important thing.” Here, “at any rate” has the same meaning as “in any case” as a transitional phrase.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “(not) want [something] at any rate,” “at any rate, we have to/should/etc.,” “for me/you/etc. at any rate,” “to me/you/etc. at any rate,” “to think so at any rate”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-180"></a>at best</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>in the most ideal scenario; in the most ideal circumstances for him/her/it/etc.; in the best possible case<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Opposite:</span> “at worst”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“You think he’s one of the best players in the world? He’s top 30 at best.”<br class="calibre6" />“At best, you can make around $40,000 per year at that company.”<br class="calibre6" />“Let’s be honest. She’s an average writer at best.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s average at best.” (In the most favourable conditions and in the kindest assessment, it’s not good or bad. It’s average.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase when you want to be honest and a little critical about the limits of something or someone. If you hear a statement about the level of quality of something or someone, but you think the statement rates the thing or person too highly, that’s when you can use “at best.” For example: “You really think that’s his best film? It’s number 5 at best.”</p>
			<p class="description">You can also use this phrase to talk about the top limits and most ideal outcomes in a particular case. Note the following examples: “You can make $15 an hour there at best”; “That medication is effective for 4 hours at best”; “That’s a terrible place to work for. At best, you’ll gain some work experience, and at worst, you’ll lose your mind.”</p>
			<p class="description">As you can see, when you use “at best,” the focus is on the negative. It means that even the best outcome is still pretty bad.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “at most,” “average at best,” “top (rank/number) at best”</span></p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	How long can you run for at best?</p>
			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-181"></a>at face value</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>the presented image of something, without asking any questions about it<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common extension:</span> “take [something] at face value”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“You can’t take what corporations say at face value. They always have a hidden agenda.”<br class="calibre6" />“You can take her words at face value. She’s a very honest person.”<br class="calibre6" />“Her first mistake was taking Max’s promises at face value.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Don’t take it at face value.” (Do not simply accept what you have been told or presented. Ask questions because it is possible you are not being told something.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“Face value” refers to the value printed on something in the financial sector, such as a bond, stock, dollar bill, life insurance policy, etc. However, while it is still used in the financial sector in this way, in everyday language, it is far more commonly used idiomatically.</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is most often used with the verbs “take,” “accept,” and “judge.” If we take someone’s words at face value, it means we take them and accept them without asking any questions. We simply believe them. Here are two examples of this usage: “I accepted their promises at face value. I didn’t think they would lie to me”; “Don’t take his words at face value. He always has a secret agenda.” The face value of something is what you see or what you are presented with. Here is another example: “At face value, this looks like a great deal.” When we take something at face value, it is possible for us to be tricked or lied to.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “accept [something or someone] at face value,” “judge [something or someone] at face value,” “take [someone’s] words at face value,” “take [something or someone] at face value,” “take what [someone] says at face value”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adjectival phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>responsible for a bad action or situation; guilty of causing something bad; the thing or person who is to blame</p>

The inspector said poor plumbing was at fault.”<br class="calibre6" />“You’re not at fault in this situation. Stop blaming yourself.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He/She was at fault.” (He/She was the person who did it. He/She was guilty.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If someone is at fault for doing something, they are the ones you blame for an unpleasant situation. This phrase is often used to discuss accidents and official court cases. For example: “The police haven’t determined who was at fault in the accident.” Here is another possible scenario: “When a relationship ends, it’s usually very difficult to say who is most at fault.” In both situations, we are finding someone to blame. The question “Who is/was at fault?” is common in these cases.</p>
			<p class="description">Things can also cause unfortunate circumstances. For instance: “Poor construction was at fault for the building’s collapse”; “A massive storm was at fault for last night’s power outage.”</p>
			<p class="description">“At fault” basically answers the question “Who or what caused this situation?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “at fault for (not) [doing something],” “is/are/was (not) at fault”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It was love at first sight.” (They fell in love the first time they met/saw each other. Also: “It was a fairy tale romance.”)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“Love at first sight” is what most people associate with this phrase. This is the idea that you can fall in love with someone the first time you see or meet them. However, “at first sight” can be used in any context that involves seeing or discovering someone or something for the first time. Here are three examples: “The house doesn’t look like much at first sight, but just wait until you see the inside”; “At first sight, it was just like any other school I had ever been to”; “The test was much easier than it appeared at first sight.”</p>

Perhaps you are at half strength or only at 30% strength. In both cases, this phrase refers to a person or a group of people not being at maximum strength, either physically or from a numbers perspective.</p>

			<p class="description">Who you are at heart is who you truly are. You can be a kind person at heart, or a vindictive person at heart, for instance. This phrase refers to the core emotions and feelings you hold inside your heart towards the world and the people around you. While this phrase typically refers to someone’s general character, you can use it in specific situations as well. For instance: “He says he’s happy for you, but I can tell that he’s jealous of you at heart.”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “What does this mean for the country at large?” (What does this generally mean for the majority of the country?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This usage is always preceded by mentioning the particular group of people you are talking about. For example: Canadians at large, the community at large, the population at large, athletes at large, men at large, etc. Use this phrase to speak about groups in general ways. For example: “Americans at large value free speech”; “Our community at large doesn’t feel safe.” The second sentence could be rephrase of “Most of the people in our community don’t feel safe.” You can use this slightly formal phrase to talk generally about any small or large group or unit of people.</p>

			<p class="description">This phrase is most often used in the present simple because it is often used in breaking news reports which refer to someone or something currently dangerous to the public. “At large” usually refers to people, but it can refer to dangerous animals as well. For instance, a news reporter or an official speaking at a press conference might make one of the following statements: “A grizzly bear escaped from the zoo this morning. It is still at large in our community”; “A SWAT team has been called to detain the criminal gang, who are still at large on the east side of the city.”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I need (a particular number) at least.” (This is the minimum number I need.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase can come before or after the number mentioned, or at the beginning or the end of a sentence. For example, all of these sentences are possible: “I want at least 5”; “I want 5 at least”; “At least, I want 5.” This is the minimum number you want. You can use this phrase in any context that involves numbers. Here is one more example which shows how you can use this phrase to give a quick answer. “How much more time do you need?” “20 minutes at least.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “a few at least,” “need/want at least [a particular number]”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “At least now you know.” (Maybe you didn’t get the answer you wanted, or maybe things ended poorly, but now you don’t have to worry about it anymore because knowing the truth is a positive.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you tell your friend that you were rejected by your romantic interest, your friend might say, “At least now you know how he/she feels.” This is a good thing! Use this phrase in this way when you want to focus on one positive aspect of a bad situation, and/or to encourage someone to see the positive side of something. For instance: “Sure, the food wasn’t that great, but at least it was cheap.”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “At least, I hope so.” (I want my previous statement to be true. I hope it is true.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Sometimes, we realize we have just said something without fully thinking about it or completely believing it. In these cases, it’s useful for us to focus our words a little more, so people know how we really feel. For instance: “This test will be easy. At least, I hope it will be.” In this sentence, you don’t know if the test will be easy, so you quickly add the second sentence to change or clarify your idea. When used in this way, “at least” often comes at the beginning of a second sentence, but it can be used in other areas as well. For example: “That was a great movie, or at the least, a memorable one.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> In writing, you will find examples of this usage with and without a comma after “at least,” as in “At least I hope so” and “At least, I hope so.” Both forms are acceptable.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “We discussed it at length.” (We discussed it in detail.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is useful in professional contexts, but can be used in casual situations as well. Here are two examples: “We discussed the future of the company at length”; “They talked about their vacation at length.” In both cases, “at length” refers to a detailed conversation. If you discuss something at length, you discuss it for a long time because you want to explore every area of it, or you want something to be understood or communicated. This phrase is often preceded by verbs such as “debate,” “discuss,” and “talk.”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’ll do it at once.” (I will do it immediately/now.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is often used with imperatives, as in “Come here at once,” “Stop what you’re doing at once,” or “Call her at once.” In all of these cases, “at once” means immediately. You can also promise to do something at once (“I’ll be there at once”), or talk about a past immediate decision (“We left the building at once”). Here are two examples using different tenses: “She texted me at once”; “I’m going to leave my house at once.”</p>

			<p class="description">“The store allowed only four people at once.” This means only four people were allowed to be in the store simultaneously. In general, “at a time” and “at the same time” are more common phrases for this usage.</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s at your discretion.” (It’s your choice/decision.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Discretion means having the freedom to decide what to do in a particular situation. When you are given a choice or an option that relies on your preference, this choice or option is at your discretion. For example, if you go to a buffet restaurant, the amount of food you eat is at your discretion. If you donate to a charity, the amount of money you give is at your discretion. If you open a bank account and you can take money from it any time you want from a bank machine, bank withdrawal times are at your discretion. In all of these cases, you are using your decision-making freedom.</p>
			<p class="description">Note that this phrase is slightly formal and is more often used in official contexts. Saying “It’s up to you” is more common in informal situations.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> If someone tells you to “use your discretion,” they mean to use your decision-making freedom, but use it carefully or wisely, and in a way that doesn’t announce your decision to everyone.</span></p>

He has billions of dollars at his disposal.”<br class="calibre6" />“The fire station only has two fire trucks at their disposal.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I don’t have one at my disposal.” (I don’t have one, or I don’t have one at this moment.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Billionaires have a lot of money at their disposal. They also have a lot of people at their disposal. Hospitals have doctors and nurses at their disposal. If something or someone is at your disposal, it or they are available and able to be used by you. It’s also possible that you don’t have something at your disposal at a particular moment. For example: “Can we use the map app on your phone to check the directions?” “Sorry, I don’t have my phone at my disposal. I forgot it at home.”</p>
			<p class="description">The proximity of an object is another common context of this phrase. For example, if you are on a technical support call, the representative might say, “I’m going to give you a reference number. Do you have a pen or pencil at your disposal?” This means “Is there a pen or pencil near you that you can use?” Finally, someone who is offering to help you with something might say “I am at your disposal,” meaning they are available and ready to help you in any way you wish. As you can see, this slightly formal phrase can be used in a variety of situations.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be at one’s disposal,” “have [something] at one’s disposal”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “at one’s service” (ex: “I am at your service.”)</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “You can do it at your leisure.” (You can do it when it is convenient for you&mdash;when you have the time and opportunity.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you do something at your leisure, you do it when you have the time to do it, and you do not rush the activity. For example, if a friend lends you a book and they don’t care when you return it to them, they might say “You can give it back at your leisure.” This means you can return it when it is convenient for you&mdash;when you have free time and don’t need the book anymore. In this way, the phrase feels similar to “at one’s discretion,” as both focus on personal convenience. However, the focus of “at one’s leisure” is on free time, while the focus of “at one’s discretion” is on any time you want. To clarify this further, if a friend sends you a news article to read, they could say “Read it at your leisure” to mean “Read it when you have free time,” as opposed to “Read it at your discretion,” which means “Read it if and/or when you wish to read it.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “call [someone] at one’s leisure,” “[do something] at one’s leisure,” “read [something] at one’s leisure,” “return [something] at one’s leisure”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s available at your request.” (It is available when you ask for it.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This is a slightly formal phrase that is common in official contexts and that is particularly useful in professional emails. For example: “At your request, I have attached a list of our services.” When you do something at someone’s request, you do it because they asked for it or perhaps even demanded it.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “[do something] at one’s request,” “be ready at one’s request,” “send [something] at one’s request,” “serve [something or someone] at one’s request”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m at peace.” (I am in a positive mental state, and my personal conditions are satisfactory.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Imagine a person who is meditating, is in a positive mental state, and is breathing calmly. This is an example of someone who is at peace. When we are at peace, we are calm and we are free from anger, anxiety, and other negative feelings. Your life can be at peace as well if you are free from negative elements. In the context of political relations, two countries can be at peace with one another. A community or a neighbourhood can also be at peace if it is free from crime, danger, and other antagonistic activities.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be (truly) at peace [with someone],” “feel (truly) at peace [with someone]”</span></p>

			<p class="description">A person can be at peace with a decision. This means they do not feel uncertain, guilty, or anxious about it&mdash;they have accepted their decision and feel calm when they think about it. You can say they are satisfied and accepting of the choice they have made. For example: “Ending our friendship wasn’t easy, but I finally feel at peace with it.” This means I have accepted that the friendship is over, and I can think about the decision calmly and with acceptance of it. You can also be at peace with a situation you didn’t cause, as in: “How do you feel about the church’s decision?” “I don’t like it, but I’m at peace with it.”</p>

			<p class="description">This phrase is used to talk about someone’s death. However, it is usually used when their death is a relief to the person’s family and to the person themselves. When a person is at peace, they are not suffering anymore. There is sometimes a feeling of relief when a friend or relative with a condition like cancer dies because they can finally rest and not have to deal with their condition&mdash;They can finally be at peace.</p>

			<p class="description">This phrase is commonly used to talk about how lottery winners are selected. You can also use it in any situation where someone or something is chosen randomly, or in any situation where something happens randomly. Here are two examples: “The teams were selected at random”; “Lately, my computer has been shutting down at random.” As you can see, randomness can refer to how something or someone is chosen, or when something happens.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “choose [someone or something] at random,” “do [something] at random,” “select [someone or something] at random,” “start [doing something] at random”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Are we at risk?” (Are we in a position where something bad might happen to us?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you are at risk of something, you are in a vulnerable position&mdash;in a place where something unpleasant might happen. For example, a person can be at risk of infection if they cut themselves and don’t clean the wound properly. If you don’t brush your teeth, you are putting yourself at risk of getting cavities or gingivitis. If your computer doesn’t have an antivirus program, it is at risk of being infected by malware.</p>
			<p class="description">As you can see, this phrase is often extended into “at risk of,” but it can be used on its own. For example: “A lot of companies in our industry are shutting down because people don’t use these types of products anymore.” “Are we at risk?” In this case, the intended question is “Are we at risk of shutting down?”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “At the age of (a specific age), I/He/She…” (I did this when I was this age.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“At the age of 25” is another way of saying “When I am/was 25 years old.” This phrase is usually used to talk about the past. For instance: “She moved out of her parents’ house at the age of 27.” However, it can be used in other tenses as well, as in “If everything goes well, I will have graduated university at the age of 22.” This phrase is often used with the words “by” and “before” as well. For example: “You need to learn to drive by/before the age of 17.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The collocation “at the ripe old age of” is a way of saying “at a very old age.” For example: “She got remarried at the ripe old age of 72.” This collocation is often used humorously.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Do not add the words “years” or “years old” after the numerical age in this phrase. “I read that book at the age of 23.” “I read that book at the age of 23 years old.”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Let’s start at the beginning.” (Let’s start at the beginning point of this story/presentation/debate/etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Because this phrase uses the preposition “at,” it refers to a specific point. In this case, the point in time when something begins, began, or will begin. For example: “At the beginning of an email, you should always greet the receiver.” The variation “right at the beginning” means “immediately at the beginning.” The variation “at the very beginning” means “at point 0,” which means as close to the actual beginning as possible.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase differs slightly from “in the beginning,” which is usually used to show contrast. For example: “In the beginning, we didn’t like each other, but after a couple of weeks, we became friends.” “In the beginning” is also used in creation stories that discuss the beginning of the universe or the beginning of life on earth. For example: “In the beginning, there was only darkness”; “In the beginning, God created the earth.” Even in these usages, you can see that more information is coming which will contrast with these beginnings.</span></p>
			<p class="description">It is important to note that “in the beginning” refers to a range of time near the beginning of something, and “at the beginning” refers to a specific moment. These phrases are often used interchangeably to discuss the beginnings of stories, movies, books, etc. (ex: “at/in the beginning of the movie”). Just remember that “at” refers to a specific point, and “in” refers to a more general period of time. In quick, casual conversation, you can often use either one to discuss the beginnings of stories, movies, etc., but “at” is preferred if to speak about the absolute starting point of a story.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “at the beginning of [a specific period],” “at the beginning of the book,” “at the beginning of the day,” “at the beginning of the movie,” “at the beginning of the story,” “at the beginning of the year”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“She lives at the end of the street.”<br class="calibre6" />“I’m almost at the end of the book.”<br class="calibre6" />“Have you finished the series?” “Not yet, but I’m right at the end.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m almost at the end.” (I have almost finished the book/movie/series/email/article/game/etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Whether it’s the end of a conversation, a news article, a movie, or anything else, “at the end” refers to the specific point where something finishes. Here are a few examples: “They both work and only see each other at the end of the day”; “At the end of the flight, I felt really dizzy”; “I’m at the very end of the novel. I can’t wait to see how it finishes!” This can also refer to a physical location, as in “The coffee shop is at the end of the street.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “At the end of the day” is an extension of this phrase, and it can refer to the literal end of a person’s day (or their work day, school day, etc.). It can also be used idiomatically to mean “when all things are taken into consideration.” For example: “He’s a terrible employee, but at the end of the day, he’s the boss’ son, so he’s not going to lose his job.” Here is another example: “At the end of the day, you need to decide what is better for you.”</span></p>
			<p class="description">Another idiomatic phrase, “I’m at the end of my rope” means you have no more patience or energy for something. For example: “I’m at the end of my rope with this job! I’m going to quit if things don’t change immediately!”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “at the end of [a specific period],” “at the end of the book,” “at the end of the day,” “at the end of the movie,” “at the end of one’s rope,” “at the end of the story,” “at the end of the street,” “at the end of the year”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “They’re laughing at your expense.” (They’re laughing at you and think you are a joke. This can be taken seriously or it can be said and received in a humorous way.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If someone takes a job in another country but loses their boyfriend or girlfriend because of it, they take a new job at the expense of their relationship. This means their relationship is harmed or comes at the cost of the decision to take the new job. This is the idea behind this phrase. You can also use the common variation to talk about the example above in this way: “I took the job at my relationship’s expense.”</p>
			<p class="description">You can use this phrase in a self-deprecating way as well. This means you make a joke about yourself. For example: “At the expense of sounding like a fool, I have no idea what you just said.” This means “I know I’m going to sound like a fool when I say this, but I have no idea what you just said.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “at the expense of one’s dignity,” “at the expense of sounding like a fool”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’ll let you know by _____ at the latest.” (I will let you know no later than this time.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase refers to the maximum future time that something is expected to happen, should happen, or is scheduled to happen. It is commonly used in office jobs. Note these common situations: “I’ll let you know by 2 o’clock at the latest”; “We need this done by tomorrow at the latest”; “The meeting will be finished by 11:30 at the latest”; “At the latest, I’ll get you the report by Thursday afternoon.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase usually uses the structure “by a time/date/etc. at the latest.” Note the examples: “Her baby is due by the end of May at the very latest”; “I want to graduate by next fall at the latest.” You can also omit “by” in many cases, especially when you are responding. For example: “When will you be finished?” “7pm at the latest”  (or, “At the latest? 7pm”).</span></p>
			<p class="description">The phrase “no later than” (or the more formal “not later than”) is common in these cases as well. For example: “The package should arrive no later than Friday” (or, “by Friday at the latest”).</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocation:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “by (a time/date/season/etc.) at the latest”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>at the beginning; at the starting point<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “at the beginning”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I just want to say this at the outset: We need this project to succeed.”<br class="calibre6" />“At the outset, everything sounded great.”<br class="calibre6" />“If we can’t be honest with each other at the outset, then we probably shouldn’t pursue this relationship any further.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “We need to know this at the outset.” (We need this information at the beginning&mdash;before we continue moving forward.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is similar to “at the beginning,” but it’s not regularly used in some of the same contexts. For example, while possible, it’s not common to say “Do you remember what happened at the outset of the book/movie/story/etc.?” Instead, “at the outset” is often used in contexts that could be personal, professional, legal, etc. For instance: “At the outset, people were excited about the baseball game.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The common variation of this phrase, “from the outset,” means that something started and likely continued. For example: “From the outset, they felt they had made a bad decision.” This means they made a bad decision, and they continued feeling that they had made a bad decision. If you’re planning something, it’s common to make your expectations clear from the outset, or to want to know something from the outset. For example: “Before we go any further, I want to make something clear from the outset.” The phrase “from the beginning” has the same usage in this case.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “at/from the outset [of something],” “make [something] clear at/from the outset,” “need to know [something] at/from the outset,” “want everyone to know [something] at/from the outset”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I did it at the same time.” (I did one thing while doing another thing simultaneously.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you’re a multi-tasker, you can do several things at the same time. This very common phrase can be used in countless contexts. Can you sing your country’s national anthem while jumping up and down at the same time? Is it possible to hold two opposing viewpoints in your mind at the same time? How many pieces of candy can you fit inside your mouth at the same time? If you have a smart phone, it can probably run many apps at the same time. All of these situations refer to doing things simultaneously or together.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “[do something] at the same time,” “go at the same time,” “leave at the same time,” “stop at the same time,” “talk at the same time”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">2.</span>used when we want to say that something else also needs to be considered (in addition); used when we want to show the complexity of a situation or idea; used when we say something that changes or contradicts what we have previously said</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I’d love to have a dog, but at the same time, I’d like to travel without worrying about who would take care of my pet.”<br class="calibre6" />“I’m in the mood for pizza. At the same time, I probably shouldn’t eat anything more today.”<br class="calibre6" />“In the job interview, he didn’t want to seem shy, and at the same time, he didn’t want to seem overconfident.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “At the same time, I’m not really sure.” (I think what I said is probably a good idea, but I’m not 100% certain.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is useful when you want to show uncertainty or when you want to highlight the complexity of a situation or decision. For instance: “Nyla wants to date Tim. At the same time, Tim is Nyla’s best friend’s brother, and she doesn’t want to ruin her friendship.” This isn’t an easy decision for Nyla.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase can come at the beginning of a new sentence, but it is also often used in the middle of a sentence after “and” or “but.” See examples 1 and 3 above for this structure.</span></p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-204"></a>at the time</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>at the time that is being discussed; during the particular time that is being mentioned<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Do not confuse with, see also:</span> “at a time”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“We went to the same university, but we didn’t know each other at the time.”<br class="calibre6" />“What were you doing at the time of the accident?”<br class="calibre6" />“At the time, no one could predict how much the pandemic would spread.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It seemed like a good idea at the time.” (No one knew it was going to be a bad idea. Everyone thought it was a good idea when it was formulated.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is most often used in the past. Here are four examples: “I didn’t know about it at the time”; “He wasn’t thinking at the time”; “We hadn’t considered it at the time”; “They had been drinking at the time.” If someone is telling you a story about their past, you might ask them one of these questions: “Where were you living at the time?”; “How old were you at the time?”; “Where were you working at the time?”; “What kind of car did you have at the time?”; “How did you feel at the time?” </p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-205"></a>at war [with someone or something]</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adjectival phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>in a state of war; in a state of conflict<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Opposite, see also: </span>“at peace [with someone]”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“They were at war for more than 10 years.”<br class="calibre6" />“There is a chance that the two countries will soon be at war.”<br class="calibre6" />“They’ve been at war with each other all morning.” (See usage note.)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “They’re at war.” (They’re in a state of armed conflict, or they are in an intense state of conflict or argument.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">When two sides are fighting against one another in armed combat, they are at war. This phrase can also be used idiomatically to mean that two sides are in an intense conflict. For example: “The rebel group is at war with the state government.” Perhaps the rebel group in this case is protesting in the streets or causing damage to government property because they are demanding change and they want to express their displeasure with the government. You can also be at war with yourself if you are attempting to do something or to improve yourself in some way, but you are struggling because of feelings of insecurity or self-sabotaging behaviours. For example: “She’s at war with herself. She could succeed if she believed in herself more.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase can be used in a hyperbolic way to refer to intense arguments. For example: “They’ve been at war in her office all morning.” Also, if you would like to mention why two sides are at war, you can use the word “over,” as in “They’re at war over oil prices,” or “They’re at war over how the company has been treating its employees lately.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be at war with [someone],” “be at war over [something]”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be at odds with [someone],” “be prepared for war,” “in conflict,” “ready to fight”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-206"></a>at will</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for saying that someone has the ability to do something whenever they want and as much as they want with minimal effort; easily and without significant effort</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“He’s an excellent soccer player. He can score at will.”<br class="calibre6" />“I wish I could travel around the world at will. Unfortunately, I’m not rich.”<br class="calibre6" />“If you had a pool, you could go swimming at will.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He/She does it at will.” (He/She does it whenever he/she wants or when he/she is asked to show their ability to others.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you can do something at will, you’re probably very talented or in a fortunate position. For example: “You don’t have to ask for permission to use the car. Just take the keys at will.” A very talented student might be able to write a great essay at will. In sports, it sometimes feels like top players can score at will.  In all three cases, the freedom and ability to do something whenever a person wants are present&mdash;the person just has to decide they want to do something.</p>
			<p class="description">If someone asks you to do something that you know how to do, but you can’t do it at any moment, you can answer “I can’t do it at will.” For instance: “Hey, Jack! Show everyone that trick you can do with a ball and a spoon!” “I can’t do it at will. It takes a lot of practice and concentration.”</p>
			<p class="description">Finally, if you’re in a position where you are given freedom, you can also use this phrase. For example: “You don’t have to knock on the door every time you come here. You can come and go at will.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “come and go at will,” “do [something] at will,” “score at will,” “stop doing [something] at will”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “on command,” “when one pleases,” “when one wants”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>at one’s job; at the place where one works</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m at work.” (I am currently at my workplace.)</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Unlike the word “home,” which can be used in the same way as other adverbs of place such as “here” and “there,” “work” needs the preposition “at.” Note these sentences, all of which are possible: “She’s at work.” “She’s at home.” “She’s home.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “always be at work,” “be at work,” “be at work all day,” “spend (too much) time at work”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He’s/She’s hard at work.” (He’s/She’s working hard.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This is an alternate phrase for “working” or “working on,” though it is not used as frequently. For example, “Shane’s at work on his latest article” is equivalent to “Shane’s working on his latest article.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can follow this phrase with “on”+a noun or noun phrase, or with a verb+ing. For instance: “We’re at work on a new policy booklet”; “We’re at work writing a new policy booklet.”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>without intending to do something; not intentionally<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Opposite, see also: </span>“on purpose”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Oops! I dropped my phone by accident.”<br class="calibre6" />“I think you sent me the wrong email by accident.”<br class="calibre6" />“Are you sure he didn’t do it on purpose?” “No, I think it was by accident.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I did it by accident.” (I didn’t intend to it.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“It did it by accident” means “I didn’t intend to do it.” Something can be an accident, or something can happen by accident. The opposite of doing something by accident is doing something on purpose.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Two other ways to say “I did it by accident” are “I didn’t mean to do it,” and “I didn’t do it on purpose.” If we feel really bad about doing something, or we want to emphasize our innocence, we often add “I swear” to these types of sentences. For instance; “It happened by accident. I swear!”; “I swear it happened by accident!”</span></p>
			<p class="description">It is also common to use modals of probability with this phrase, especially “must have” to say you are very certain that something happened by accident. For example: “Where’s your purse?” “On no! I must have left it on the bus by accident!”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “call/message [someone] by accident,” “[do something] by accident,” “drop [something] by accident,” “leave [something] by accident”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-209"></a>by all accounts</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>according to all of the information that is currently known and/or available; based on what people have said<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variation:</span> “from all accounts”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“By all accounts, the community isn’t happy with the new traffic law.”<br class="calibre6" />“Should I buy this pot?” “By all accounts, it’s a good brand, so yes.”<br class="calibre6" />“By all accounts I’ve heard, Sammy is a great boss.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “By all accounts, it’s supposed to be pretty good.” (Based on everything I have heard, it (the movie, the restaurant, the book, etc.) is supposed to be pretty good.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">An account of something or someone is a statement or general opinion of something or someone. “By all accounts” can therefore be understood as “By all statements and opinions,” or “When we go by all of the information that is available.” Use this phrase when you want to provide a reason for your beliefs, statements, opinions, etc. For example: “By all accounts, it’s going to be a sunny day tomorrow.” This means I have probably checked various weather reports, and all of them have said the same thing.</p>
			<p class="description">You can show that you are uncertain of something by saying “by all known accounts,” which leaves room for accounts that are unknown for some reason. You can also show stronger confidence by saying “by all reputable accounts,” which means the sources of the information have a reputation of providing accurate details.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “From all accounts” is interchangeable with “by all accounts.” </span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “by all accounts one has heard,” “by all available accounts,” “by all known accounts,” “by all reputable accounts”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “based on what one has heard,” “based on what one knows”</span></p>

Here you go.”<br class="calibre6" />“We’d like to see the dessert menu.” “Of course! By all means.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “By all means.” (Yes. Please do so. I am inviting you or giving you permission.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This is usually a standalone response, or one that is preceded by “yes.” It is also often followed by an imperative. Here are two examples: “By all means, take a look”; “Is this seat available?” “Yes. By all means, please sit down.” As you can see, saying “by all means” invites someone, allows someone, or gives permission to someone to do something. There is a very open feeling to this phrase, as you are inviting someone to fully accept your “yes.” “By all means” is like saying “Yes, of course. Do what you need or want to do.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “as you wish,” “be my guest,” “feel free,” “of course”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “By any means necessary.” (This is a response that means “Do what you need to do to achieve the desired result.”)</span></p>
			<p class="description">The noun “means” means “ways.” The phrase “by any means necessary” means to use any ways that are necessary to achieve something. This phrase is usually used with a negative connotation, as “by any means necessary” often means that you have to do something unpleasant, unethical, or immoral to achieve your goal. In this way, it is similar to “at all costs.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can say “I don’t care what it takes” to mean “I want you to do this by any means necessary.” You can also remove “by” and use this as an imperative: “Use any means necessary.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “do [something] by any means necessary,” “survive by any means necessary,” “win by any means necessary”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “We met by chance.” (We met unexpectedly.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">When something happens by chance, it happens without any planning. Another way to think about this phrase is that it’s similar to “by luck.” However, “chance” refers to the probability of something happening. If you see someone you know in a public place, you might also say, “Wow! What are the chances? I can’t believe you’re here!”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “meet by chance,” “run into [someone] by chance,” “see [someone] by chance,” “win by chance”</span></p>

			<p class="description">This usage is for requests, offers, and questions. When you use “by chance” as in the examples above, you are making your inquiry more polite. You are also usually hoping the answer is “yes” because you want something or you want to offer something.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is not a direct substitution for “perhaps” or “maybe” in declarative sentences. This usage of “by chance” is only possible with requests, offers, and other questions. </span></p>

			<p class="description">This phrase means to do something because you choose to do it. “I married him by choice” means “I chose to marry him because I wanted to, not because I felt pressured to.” People live in places by choice, go to places by choice, and make decisions by choice. For example, if you have the option to take a bus to work but you choose to walk because of the health benefits, you can say “I walk to work by choice.” Outside pressures or feelings of obligation are not part of your decision when you do something by choice.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “do [something] by choice,” “go [somewhere] by choice,” “leave [somewhere or someone] by choice,” “live [somewhere] by choice,” “work [somewhere] by choice”</span></p>

			<p class="description">We usually use this phrase when we want to clarify or emphasize something. For example: “By definition, Becky is an independent contractor. She is not a full-time employee in our company.” This sentence clarifies and emphasizes Becky’s status at the same time. “By definition” stresses the literal definition of something or someone. Here is one more example: “Dan is a police officer. It doesn’t matter if he’s your friend. By definition, he has to arrest you.”</p>

That was by design.”<br class="calibre6" />“The rich getting richer isn’t an accident&mdash;it’s by design. It’s how our economy was built.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s by design.” (That’s how the product/system/organization/company/etc. is intended to function.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Before anything is built, it is planned. In the design stages, creators decide how specific things will function. For example, if a car company creates a car with a very loud horn because they want it to be loud, the loud horn is added to the car by design. This phrase is often used to discuss facts, but it is also used to express criticism or cynicism about something, as in example 3 above. Here is another similar example: “Why is my laptop so slow? I’ve only had it for 3 years.” “I think most consumer technology is built to slow down after 2-3 years by design.” This means I think consumer technology companies make their products slow down after 2-3 years on purpose&mdash;because they want you to buy a newer model every 2-3 years.</p>
			<p class="description">While this phrase is often used to discuss how products and systems are designed to function, it can also be used to talk about personal plans and intentions. For instance: “Did you leave your wallet at my house by accident?” “No, that was by design. I wanted you to find and bring it to me, so I could see you again.”</p>

			<p class="description">This phrase is used to compare and emphasize the great distance in quality, performance, preference, or simply the difference between two people, things, categories, etc. Because of this, it is most often used with comparative and superlative adjectives. For instance: “She’s stronger than her by far” (comparative). “He’s the best player in the league by far” (superlative). “By far” means there is a significant gap in superiority.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> For superlatives, you can place “by far” before the adjective or at the end of the statement. Note these examples: “This one is by far the best”; “This one is the best by far.” For comparatives, placing “by far” at the end is preferred. For example: “He’s taller than you by far.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “By far” is also used when we discuss preference. In some cases, comparative and superlative adjectives are not necessary. For example: “This is my favourite restaurant by far!”; “I prefer this one by far.” In these cases, you can also change the placement of “by far,” as in: “This is by far my favourite restaurant,” and “I by far prefer this one.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">This phrase is often used in the context of writing and drawing. However, it can refer to any situation where you do not use technology or other aids to help you do or create something (see example 3). In this case, perhaps your grandmother sewed a hat or made a small clay statue with her hands.</p>

			<p class="description">Use this phrase to emphasize when something is personally delivered to someone because you want to make sure they receive it. The two most common verbs with this usage are “deliver” and “give.” If you are the receiver of something, the two most common verbs are “get” and “receive,” as in “I got/received it by hand.”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I know it by heart.” (I know it without needing to think about it. I have internalized it and I can recall it quickly and easily.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you know something by heart, you know it very well and you don’t have to think about it. For example, if someone asks you “What’s six times six?” and you automatically answer “Thirty-six,” you know the six-times tables by heart. They are committed to your long-term memory and you can recite them automatically. Anything that you have an automatic knowledge of, such as the words to a song, the streets in a city, a secret family recipe, or anything that requires memorization, you know by heart.

			<p class="description">Actions are prohibited, permitted, or required by law. This means there is a legal obligation to do (or not do) something in society because of the official legal rules of that society. Here are two examples: “By law, you need to be at least 16 years old to drive in the province”; “You’re not allowed to park there by law.” An interchangeable synonym for this phrase is “legally.”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It has improved by leaps and bounds.” (It has improved with incredible rapidity and to an easily noticeable degree.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“Leap” and “bound” are synonyms for the word “jump.” If something happens by leaps and bounds, it happens quickly&mdash;to a degree that is very noticeable. This means there are incredible changes in the state of someone or something, so it seems like it or they “jump” from one state to another state. This phrase usually has a positive usage, which is why we usually use verbs like “grow,” “improve,” and “expand” with it. For example: “His singing skills have improved by leaps and bounds”; “Their sales numbers have grown by leaps and bounds.” Because the focus is on how different someone or something is when compared to the past, the verb “change” is also common, as in “His negative attitude is changing by leaps and bounds.”</p>
			<p class="description">Negative sentences are also possible with this phrase, though they are not nearly as common. Here are two possible examples: “Their recent performances have disappointed people by leaps and bounds”; “His condition is deteriorating by leaps and bounds.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The present perfect is very common with this phrase, though it can be used in any tense.

			<p class="description">We make mistakes when we are not paying careful attention to something or when we are not fully present in the moment. This phrase is almost the same as “by accident,” as both phrases refer to doing something without the intention of doing it. For example: “Sometimes, I call my son his brother’s name by mistake.” In this case, the person probably wasn’t very present in the moment and paying attention to their words, so they called one of their sons his brother’s name.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“By no means should you trust him.” (You shouldn’t trust him in any way.)<br class="calibre6" />“By no means do I think he’s a bad person.” (I don’t think he’s bad.)<br class="calibre6" />“She’s not an expert on this subject. Not by any means.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “By no means am I saying that…(+independent clause)” (I am not saying this in any way.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This formal phrase is useful in professional and official contexts. Note the inversion of the subject and auxiliary verb in examples 1 and 2. This is necessary if “by no means” comes at the beginning of a sentence. Here are two sentences with the same meaning but two different structures: “I am by no means saying that he’s right”; “By no means am I saying that he’s right.” In both cases, a negation is being emphasized.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> In tenses that have an auxiliary verb and a main verb, as in the present continuous and present perfect, if you begin the sentence with a subject, place “by no means” between the auxiliary verb and the main verb. Here are two examples: “She is by no means asking you to do it,” which means she isn’t asking you to do it, and “We have by no means broken any laws,” which means we haven’t broken any laws&mdash;not in any way.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “by no means should I/we/etc.,” “by no means am I saying that [+independent clause],” “by no means do I think that [+independent clause]”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>by strictly following the rules, instructions, or procedures, as they are written</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Dana is the type of boss who likes doing things by the book.”<br class="calibre6" />“The police have solved the case by going by the book.”<br class="calibre6" />“If you always go by the book, you’ll never be surprised by anything.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Let’s go by the book.” (Let’s do things according to the official instructions, rules, policies, etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Every professional company has a book of official procedures. We can consider this “the book” in this phrase. If you go by the book, you follow the official rules and you do not leave any room for exceptions or doing things differently. The most common verb with this phrase is “go,” as in “We should go by the book.” You can also “do things by the book,” as in “Shawn never does things by the book.” In this case, we mean that Shawn does his job how he wants, not by following the official procedures.</p>
			<p class="description">Usually, if you don’t want to get into trouble with your boss, it is a good idea to go by the book. However, there are exceptional circumstances when it is a good idea not to go by the book. In any case, we choose to follow or not to follow a particular system.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “(not) do things by the book,” “(not) go by the book”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “break the rules,” “follow the rules,” “take/use a systematic approach”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Can I call you at 6?” “Sure, I’ll be done work by then.”<br class="calibre6" />“Natalie apologized, but by then, it was already too late.”<br class="calibre6" />“Why didn’t you tell me this when you saw me yesterday?” “I hadn’t known by then.” (To refer to a specific time, you can also say “at that time.”)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Will you be done by then?” (Will you be finished by that time?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you do things by a particular time, you do them before or close to that time. The phrase “by then” refers to a particular time in this case. For example: “I had wanted to finish the project by Friday, but I didn’t finish it by then.” Here is another situation: “Clarissa didn’t start writing her essay until 10pm. By then, she was too tired to write anything decent.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “done by then,” “finished by then,” “over by then,” “start by then,” “too late by then”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “For all intents and purposes, I agree.” (I might disagree with some aspects, but in every way that matters, I agree.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase to say “practically speaking.” To be more specific, use this phrase when you want to say that even though something is not exactly true or the same, it is close enough to being true or the same. This phrase is often used to say that something can be used in a particular situation even though it’s not the same as something else. For example: “For all intents and purposes, a notebook is just as effective at killing flies as a fly swatter.” In example 2, “for all intents and purposes” is being used to say “Even though there might be some things that haven’t been answered about the case, the police have done everything they could, and the case has been closed.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “on the whole,” “practically speaking”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>regardless of what happens; accepting the consequences whether they’re good or bad</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“For better or worse, he’s the new CEO of the organization.”<br class="calibre6" />“They’ve been married for 15 years for better or worse.”<br class="calibre6" />“For better or worse, local officials decided to leave the controversial monument in the centre of the city.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “That’s it, for better or worse.” (We have made the decision, and now we have to deal with the consequences, good or bad.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">When you make a decision that you know has positive and negative outcomes, you make that decision for better or worse. It is common in many marriage ceremonies to say you will stay with your partner for better or worse. This means you will stay with them regardless of the potential outcomes. There is a bittersweet (and sometimes anxious or hesitant) feeling to this phrase because it acknowledges that most things in life have a good side and a bad side.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be married for better or worse,” “decide [something] for better or worse,” “make a decision for better or worse”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “no matter the consequences/outcome,” “regardless of the consequences/outcome”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>forever and/or permanently<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “once and for all”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s/They’re gone for good.” (It’s/They’re gone forever. It/They will never return.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This is a versatile phrase, as it can be used with a variety of parts of speech. Here are three examples: “That building is there for good”; “She wants to stay for good”; “The government has voted. This will be our capital city for good.” If something is permanent or forever, it is for good. There can be a sense of dramatic importance to this informal phrase. If you finish paying for a car or a house, for example, you can say “Now it’s mine for good.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “done for good,” “here/there for good,” “finished for good,” “gone for good,” “leave for good,” “together for good”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>in addition to other things; more than is necessary to make something better or more complete; adding a little extra of something because one wants to</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Here, take a pamphlet. Actually, take two for good measure. One for you and one for a friend.”<br class="calibre6" />“Add some paprika, and if you want, some more salt for good measure.”<br class="calibre6" />“I’ll take that one. And give me that one too for good measure.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Take one more for good measure.” (Take an extra one just because you can, or just in case you need it.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase to say something is added to something else, not because it is necessarily needed, but because you want to add it, or because it makes something better or more complete. For example: “I finished watching that series you recommended, and I watched the ‘Making Of’ special for good measure.” In this case, the person watched the ‘Making Of’ special about the series they watched because they enjoyed the series and wanted more of it. Watching the special made the experience more complete. To provide another context, in combat sports, if a fighter such as a boxer or mixed martial artist gives their opponent an extra punch, an announcer might say “And he gives him one more for good measure!”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “add [something] for good measure,” “an extra one for good measure,” “one more for good measure,” “take [something] for good measure”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>for the moment; temporarily; for the current period of time until the next event happens or until there are more developments<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “for the time being,” “in the meantime”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I need a few more minutes. Could you just wait here for now?”<br class="calibre6" />“Do you want something to drink?” “No, thanks. I’m fine for now.”<br class="calibre6" />“For now, the employees are satisfied with their work conditions.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m okay/fine/good for now.” (I do not require anything at the moment. I am content with the present state of things.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Something that is the case “for now” can change in the future. “For now” refers to the present moment, which is always temporary. You can ask someone to do something or to wait somewhere “for now” because what they are waiting for is not ready yet. This can be a doctor’s appointment, a visit to the bank, or anything that requires them to wait for something to happen.</p>
			<p class="description">You can also be satisfied with something for now, but future events might change that. Here are two more examples: “I’m happy with my phone for now. It can still run all of my favourite apps” (This will likely change in the future); “They’re getting along for now” (They might not in the future).</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Here are a few more common uses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “That’s it for now”; “We’re done for now”; “That’s enough for now”; “I’m good for now”; “It’s fine for now.”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>in this case, as opposed to what usually happens; sometimes said when you want someone to do something they don’t usually do, but that you wish they did more often<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common extensions: </span>“for once in one’s life,” “just for once”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Clean your room for once!”<br class="calibre6" />“It would be great if she would listen to me for once.”<br class="calibre6" />“I’m happy that you look happy for once.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Listen for once.” (Listen to me in this case. I wish you listened more.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is often used in imperatives, as in “Listen to me for once,” “Clean your room for once,” or “Smile for once.” In all of these cases, the implied meaning is that these things don’t usually happen. When you ask someone to do something for once, you want them to do it in this particular situation, and you wish they did it more often. In short, “for once” can also mean “one time.”</p>
			<p class="description">The common extension “for once in your life” makes this phrase even more dramatic. For instance: “For once in your life, do the right thing!”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be happy for once,” “[do something] for once,” “help for once,” “listen [to someone] for once,” “smile for once”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I liked it for the most part.” (Overall, I liked it. This can refer to an experience you had, a book you read, a class you took, etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase when you want to say that something is usually the case, or that something is mostly true. For example: “For the most part, kids prefer to play with others than by themselves.” In this example, kids preferring to play with others is usually the case. Here is another example: “It was a good movie for the most part.” Overall, it was a good movie.</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “For the record, I had no idea.” (I want to officially state that I didn’t know anything about this situation.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“The record” in this case refers to an official record or document with public statements. In an official capacity, this phrase is used in a court of law. For instance, “Would you please state your name for the record?” is a common question a court official asks a witness, a defendant, or the accused. However, this phrase is also used in casual speech, either seriously or humorously. It is usually used at the beginning of a sentence as if to say “Listen to me. This is what I actually think.”</p>
			<p class="description">As mentioned, it can be used humorously, as in “For the record, I’ve always enjoyed your cooking.” You might say this after someone else has criticized your friend’s cooking in a light-hearted manner. If you say something for the record, you don’t mind who knows it because it is your official public position.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The related phrase “on the record” is also common. Something can be on the record, be left on the record, or be put on the record. “On record” and “on the record” can often be used interchangeably. A person can also “go on record.” For example: “I’d like to go on record to state that I do not support this decision.”</span></p>
			<p class="description">When we don’t want our words to be public knowledge, we can use the phrase “off the record.” For example: “Off the record, I never thought this was a good idea.” In this case, I always thought the idea was bad, but I don’t want you to report my words to anyone.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocation:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “state something for the record”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be on (the) record,” “go on (the) record,” “leave [something] on (the) record,” “off the record,” “put [something] on (the) record,” “set the record straight”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “For the sake of argument, let’s say you’re right.” (For the purpose of our discussion, let’s imagine your argument is correct. This is usually followed by questions that are used to test the argument.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">The context of a sentence will tell you if it’s for the purpose or the benefit of something or someone. For example: “He did it for the sake of his marriage” means he did it for the benefit of his marriage. In this case, purpose wouldn’t make sense. Here is an example that refers to purpose: “For the sake of being honest, I want to tell you that I was jealous of you.”</p>
			<p class="description">“For the sake of argument,” or “For argument’s sake” are two of the most common collocations with this phrase.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Here are the two sentences in the explanation above used with the common variations of this phrase: “He did it for his marriage’s sake”; “For honesty’s sake, I want to tell you that I was jealous of you.”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Wait here for the time being.” (Wait here for now.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is synonymous with “for now.” When you do something for the time being, you do it temporarily as you wait for something to happen, to develop, or to become more possible. In some cases, we don’t know if the situation will change in the future. For example: “For the time being, relations between the two countries are peaceful.” This means things could change in the future, but for now, there is peace between the two countries. Example 1 above also shows this usage.</p>

			<p class="description">When you design a building, you start from the ground and build upward. This is the essence of this phrase. You can build something, learn something, or know something from the ground up. For instance, a computer programmer can develop a new application from the ground up.</p>
			<p class="description">If you know something from the ground up, you know it very well. For example: “He knows the history of that company from the ground up.” This means he has a thorough knowledge of the company&mdash;from its beginnings until now.</p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>from one perspective or point of view; used when one wants to say that something is partially accurate, especially when one looks at it from a certain perspective (and there are other perspectives/options available)<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variation:</span> “in [a particular sense],” “in one sense”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “in a way”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Do you mean he’s right?” “In a sense, but not exactly.”<br class="calibre6" />“In a professional sense, she’s a typical lawyer.”<br class="calibre6" />“In a sense, we were like brothers.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “That’s true in a sense.” (That is true from one point of view. “In a sense” is often interchanged with “in a way” in this sentence.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase to focus on a particular way of thinking or understanding something. “In a sense” refers to a point of view. For example: “In a sense, she’s a perfect mother.” This means that depending on how you define a perfect mother, she is a perfect mother from one point of view.</p>
			<p class="description">You can focus this phrase more by adding the type of sense or perspective you mean, as in example 2 above. Here is another example of this usage: “It wasn’t a smart decision in an economic sense.” This means it was not a smart decision from an economic perspective.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is very similar to “in a way,” and is often used interchangeably with it. The subtle difference is that “in a sense” refers to a particular perspective, while “in a way” refers to “in a certain fashion” or “in a certain style.” The difference is subtle, which is why they’re often used interchangeably, as they can be in examples 1 and 3 above. Phrases like “in a political sense” are not interchangeable with “in a political way,” however.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “good in a sense,” “right in a sense,” “true in a sense,” “wrong in a sense”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “from one perspective,” “from a certain point of view”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-237"></a>in a way</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>in a certain style or fashion; in some way; true in some respects<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variations:</span> “in one way,” “in some way,” “in some ways”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “in a sense”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“In a way, you’ve helped us more than anyone else.”<br class="calibre6" />“In a way, this was the best possible outcome.”<br class="calibre6" />“Elvis was the first real music celebrity in a way.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “In a way, you’re right.” (This is similar to “In a sense, you’re right,” which means you are right from a particular perspective or way of understanding things. It’s believable that you’re right.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you want to soften the force of a statement, this can be a useful phrase. For example, if you don’t want to commit to saying “Elvis was the first real music celebrity,” but you want to say that in a particular style he actually was, you can add “in a way” as in example 3 above. This phrase is usually interchangeable with “in a sense.” (Read the usage note for “in a sense” for more details on the subtleties between the two phrases.)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “In some way” is often used for desires to be part of something, as in “I’d like to help in some way”; “She wants to contribute in some way”; or “We wish we could be a part of the concert in some way.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “bad in a way,” “good in a way,” “in a certain way,” “in a very real way,” “right in a way,” “true in a way,” “wrong in a way”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>also; as well; besides; used when one wants to add another relevant item to the topic that is being discussed<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common extension:</span> “in addition to [something or someone]”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“They have a strong wi-fi network. In addition, internet data is unlimited.”<br class="calibre6" />“In addition to all of those features, the car has a remote start option.”<br class="calibre6" />“We will discuss the environmental impact of this decision. In addition, we will propose some solutions to potential problems.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Is there anything in addition to that?” (Is there anything else added to that? Is there anything else I need to know about?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase comes at the beginning of a new sentence and relates to something already discussed. The common extension “in addition to” can come in the middle of a sentence as well. Here are two examples of this usage: “Naomi enjoys doing pilates in addition to judo”; “There is a one-time service charge in addition to the cost of the phone.”</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is commonly used in professional and academic contexts, especially in writing. For example: “Dear Mr. Burns, I have attached a detailed list of our services. In addition, I would like to offer you a free tour of our facilities to help you feel more comfortable with your decision.” </p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “along with (this/that),” “on top of that”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial or prepositional phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>in the time, interval, or space that separates two or more things</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I go to the gym on Mondays and Fridays, and sometimes in between.”<br class="calibre6" />“A spork is neither a spoon nor a fork. It’s in between.”<br class="calibre6" />“They’re not friends and they’re not lovers. They’re somewhere in between.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m somewhere in between.” (I’m somewhere in the middle of the categories we are discussing. This could refer to your political alignment or if you are between two opinions on something.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">In speaking, “in between” and “between” are often used interchangeably. However, “in between” is more common when it comes at the end of a sentence and is not followed by an object, as in the examples above. For every other case where there is an object, the preposition “between” is correct because it already means that something is in the space of at least two things. Here are some examples: “I dropped my phone between the wall and the couch”; “He’s between jobs right now”; “What do you do between classes?” As noted, in speaking, many English speakers use “in between” in these cases as well even though it is redundant.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> To be safe, use “between” when it is followed by an object, and “in between” when it is at the end of a sentence. You can also use the hyphenated form, “in-between,” as a noun or adjective. For instance: “I know this job isn’t the one you want. It’s just an in-between” (noun). “That’s not the final stop. That’s just an in-between station” (adjective).</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “check in between,” “look in between,” “someone in between,” “something in between,” “some time in between,” “somewhere in between”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “between a rock and a hard place,” “between friends,” “between jobs,” “between two places,” “in the middle of [something or someone],” “stuck between two places/people/choices/etc.”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Bring/Take it just in case.” (Bring/Take it with you as a precaution. You might need it.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you are the type of person who likes to be prepared for multiple scenarios, you probably do a lot of things “just in case.” Here are three more scenarios: “We should bring our umbrellas in case it rains”; “Here is my phone number in case you need to call me”; “In case you have forgotten the rules of the game, here is the instruction manual.” In all of these situations, we do things to prepare for the possibility of something happening.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Just in case” is more delicate than “in case,” and is also commonly used as a standalone phrase. For example: “Why did you give me this?” “Just in case.” The first person might then ask “Just in case of what?”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The variation “in case of” is often used on official signs. For instance: “In case of fire, break glass.” “Press button in case of emergency.” In these two cases, the meanings are “Break the glass in the event of a fire” and “Press this button in the event of an emergency.” Said another way, follow these steps if the stated situations happen.</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Who’s in charge?” (Who is the boss? Who is the person leading this or responsible for overseeing this?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If someone is in charge of a group of employees, they are the person responsible for the employees. If someone walks into an event that is disorganized, they might ask “Who’s is charge of this?” because they want to speak to the person who is responsible for the poor event. You can be in charge of particular jobs or tasks. For instance: “Christian is in charge of distributing the information pamphlets”; “I’d like to be in charge of the drinks for tomorrow’s party.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> In formal usage, a person can be someone’s charge. For example, “The boy is my charge” means that I am responsible for the boy. I am likely an important authority figure and/or caretaker in his life. While this usage does not occur with a high degree of frequency, it is possible you might hear it in some older period English films.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Follow the phrase “in charge of” with a noun (“food”), noun phrase (“the marketing department”), pronoun (“them”), or gerund (“advertising”).</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “We have nothing in common.” (We do not have any similar interests, values, etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you are friends with someone, you probably have/share some things in common with them. For instance: “She’s my best friend. We have a love of animals in common.” This means we both love animals. You can have physical things in common, such as hair colour, height, etc. For example: “We’re both tall, so we have that in common.” You can also compare two things and discuss how they are alike or different. For example: “Those two tables have a lot in common, but one is much more expensive.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Have” is the most common verb that is used with this phrase, but “share” is also used. For example: “We have a lot in common!”; “Those books share almost nothing in common.” Quantifiers are very often used with this phrase as well. For example: “We have a lot/a little/nothing/much/very little in common.”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>covering many or all important aspects of a topic; in significant detail<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “in detail”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Henry has studied the history of Western philosophy in depth.”<br class="calibre6" />“In next session’s literature class, we will discuss this book in great depth.”<br class="calibre6" />“We have already covered this topic in depth, so there is no need to go back to it.” (We do not have to talk about it again.)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “We talked about it in depth.” (We talked about the majority or all of the most important aspects of the topic.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">When we think of depth, we usually think of a body of water and how far down it goes before our feet touch the bottom. This is a good way to think about this phrase: The deeper you study a topic, the closer you get to the bottom of it. Therefore, if you have a deep understanding or a deep knowledge of a topic, you can discuss it in depth. For instance: “Marita can talk about the history of Italian filmmaking in significant depth. She has studied Italian filmmaking for more than 20 years.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is similar to and often interchangeable with “in detail,” which focuses on a careful and thorough understanding of something. However, in some situations, one phrase is better than the other. For example, if someone asks you to review a long legal document so that you can understand every aspect of it, it is better to say “Study this in detail” than “Study this in depth.” If you study it in depth, you will still have a strong understanding of the most important parts of the document, but maybe you will not be able to explain every single little aspect of it.</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">To provide another context, when discussing a painter recreating a classic painting, we cannot say that he or she recreated the painting in depth; it is much more common to say he or she recreated it in detail.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Turn this phrase into an adjective by adding a hyphen. For example: “Sunhee has in-depth knowledge of Korean cooking techniques.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “discuss [something] in depth,” “know [something] in depth,” “study [something] in depth,” “talk about [something] in depth,” “understand [something] in depth”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I want you to review this policy in detail and then explain it to me.”<br class="calibre6" />“The essay answer was poor. The student did not support his position in any significant detail.”<br class="calibre6" />“We discussed it for several hours in painstaking detail.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “We talked about it in detail.” (We discussed every aspect carefully and thoroughly.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you discuss something in detail, you discuss every part of it, and you do it carefully so that the subject is thoroughly understood. You can review a company’s terms and conditions in detail, talk about your childhood in detail, or study a book in detail. A friend can tell you about a recent positive or negative experience in detail. In all of these cases, you make sure to cover every aspect of the subject so you understand it completely and from a variety of perspectives. An artist can also create or recreate something in (great) detail. For example: “She recreated the painting in fantastic detail.” See also: example 3 above.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Adjectives are often placed in the middle of this phrase to clarify the type of detail that is used. See the collocations below for some of the most common forms.</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">The collocation “in painstaking detail” is one of the most common phrases and means to discuss or do something carefully and laboriously. This phrase emphasizes the idea of doing something or talking about something in a disciplined manner without jumping from one point to the next, but by going one small step at a time. It can be difficult and require a lot of personal discipline not to get bored or sloppy. Note the example: “We reviewed the proposal in painstaking detail. We didn’t miss anything.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “discuss in detail,” “in awe-inspiring detail,” “in great detail,” “in incredible detail,” “in painstaking detail,” “in significant detail,” “look at [something] in detail,” “review in detail,” “talk about in detail”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “All in due course.” (This will happen when it is supposed to happen or when it usually happens. Just wait because there is nothing you can do to quicken the process at the moment.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This formal phrase means that something will happen when it is supposed to happen, or when it usually happens. Patience is often associated with this phrase, as it is often used in sentences that require someone to wait for something. For instance: “We apologize for the delay, but rest assured that your package will arrive in due course.” “Course” in this phrase refers to the course or movement of time and events. If something happens “in due course,” it happens when it is due (or meant) to happen.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “arrive in due course,” “be ready in due course,” “come in due course,” “happen in due course,” “know [something] in due course,” “reveal [something] in due course”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “In essence, you’re right.” (You are right in the most general and fundamental way, although you might not be 100% right because things are not that simple.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">The essence of something is its spirit&mdash;its basic nature. This is the feeling of this phrase. For example: “In essence, Kris is a trustworthy person.” This means that Kris’ true nature is that she is trustworthy. Use this phrase to focus on the main or most important part of what you are saying. For instance: “What you are telling me, in essence, is that our business is going to fail. Is that right?” When using “in essence,” we want to simplify a topic to its most basic and honest nature.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> If something is “of the essence,” it is of great importance. The most popular sentence with this phrase is “Time is of the essence,” which means we need to hurry because time is very important in this case.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “in essence, one believes,” “in essence, one is,” “in essence, one should,” “in essence, one thinks”</span></p>

			<p class="description">Use this phrase and its variations to give more detailed information about something. For instance: “Phillip is incredibly helpful. In fact, he has been volunteering at the homeless shelter for the past 3 months.” Here, we are providing a factual example of how Phillip is an incredibly helpful person. You can also use “in fact” and its variations to provide a contrast to what has been said before. For example: “We thought the product would be successful. In actual fact, our sales numbers were abysmal.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is most often used at the beginning of a new sentence, but it can be used at the end or in the middle of a sentence, as shown in examples 2 and 3 above. The variations, “in actual fact” and “in point of fact” are much more common and sound more natural at the beginning of a new sentence. Here are two examples: “He thought he would easily win the competition. In actual fact, he was eliminated in the first round”; “Getting a personal trainer has been the best decision I’ve ever made. In point of fact, I’m healthier than I’ve ever been.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “correct in fact,” “right in fact,” “true in fact,” “wrong in fact”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “as a matter of fact,” “if truth be told,” “in actuality,” “in truth,” “to tell [someone] the truth”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m in favour of it.” (I support it. If we are discussing our preferences in this situation, this is the side I prefer.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This slightly formal phrase is common when discussing preferences. For example: “Janet is in favour of remodeling the office.” This phrase can also mean that something is to one’s benefit. For example: “The judge ruled in favour of the defendant.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage notes:</span><span class="charoverride2"> When you ask people to vote on a decision, you can say “All in favour?” and wait for those who agree with you to say “yes.” A common variation of this is “All in favour say ‘I,’” followed by people saying “I” if they support or agree with you.</span></p>
			<p class="description">“Do you support” is another way of saying “Are you in favour of.” For instance, “Are you in favour of strict immigration laws?” is another way of saying “Do you support strict immigration laws?” “In favour of” is often used when discussing important public issues such as capital punishment, abortion, immigration, drug laws, etc.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “in favour of capital punishment,” “in favour of democracy,” “in favour of legal abortion,” “in favour of stricter/stronger regulations”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “In general, yes/no.” (When I think about the overall situation, then yes/no. Use this when you don’t want to fully commit to a yes or no answer. Ex: “Do you support strict drug laws?” “In general, no.” In this case, there is room for supporting some aspects of laws against drugs.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">When you are speaking about something in general, you are speaking about its whole or overall nature, not its specific pieces. We all have general feelings about things, and we are able to give our general assessment of a person, thing, or situation. Here are two examples: “In general, Lisa has been doing a great job”; “The country in general is a better place to live in today than it was 3 years ago.” Just because things are positive in general doesn’t mean we should ignore the negatives, but sometimes, it can be helpful to look at the general picture to see the positives, and vice versa.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “In general” is usually used at the beginning of a sentence, but can be used in other parts (as in examples 2 and 3). Here are some other examples: “I’m happy in general”; “In general, she’s a good leader”; “The streets feel safer, so in general, the government’s plan has worked.”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “In light of recent events,...” (Because of or considering recent events. This is a common way to start a sentence when we want to state that something has changed or been decided because of something significant that has recently happened.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Light improves our ability to see something. When you think of this phrase, imagine a light shining on the topic that is being discussed. “In light of” is usually used when something new or recent happens or becomes known (or, when it “comes to light”), but it can be used in a more general way. Here are two examples: “In light of wanting to improve her health, Sydney joined a local basketball league”; “You can’t just discuss this painting by itself. You need to discuss it in light of the painter’s other works.” The first sentence can be re-written as “Considering that Sydney wanted to improve her health, she joined a local basketball league.” The second sentence means you need to consider or take into account the painter’s other works.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Something can “come to light,” which means that new information is discovered or becomes known. Note the examples: “New information has come to light”; “It has come to light that the construction company did not finish the job properly”; “We need to be careful. This document can’t come to light.” (It can’t be discovered by others.)</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “in light of new information,” “in light of public concerns,” “in light of recent events,” “in light of recent findings,” “in light of safety concerns” “in light of the news”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s in line with my expectations.” (It’s in accord, agreement, or conformity with my expectations.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">When you are in line with someone, you are in agreement or in conformity with them. Note the examples: “Sorry, Tom, but I’m in line with Neil on this issue”; “I voted for him because his politics are more in line with my beliefs.” When you think of this phrase, imagine multiple lines/queues of beliefs, ideas, opinions, people, etc., and you choosing one of the lines instead of the others. Note that in example 2 above, a document can be in line with or not in line with what you discussed with someone. Something can also be in line with or not in line with your hopes, expectations, wishes, etc. For instance: “The apartment looked great in pictures, but when I visited it in person, it wasn’t in line with my expectations” (or, “It wasn’t in line with what I expected”).</p>
			<p class="description">To provide one more context, a person’s current behaviour or mood can be in line with their past behaviour or mood. For instance: “Dan’s been really quiet lately. His behaviour hasn’t been in line with how he usually acts.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> If you want someone to agree or conform to something, you can use the phrase “get in line with,” as in “You need to get in line with the company rules.”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“The books are in alphabetical order.” (adjective, modifies “the books”)<br class="calibre6" />“You need to get your room in order.” (adjective, modifies “your room”)<br class="calibre6" />“Please line up in order.” (adverb phrase, modifies the verb “line up”)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Put it/them in order.” (Tidy it/them or put it/them in an organized sequence. This could refer to organizing documents on your computer, or to organizing books from A to Z on a bookshelf, for instance.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“Order” refers to organization. Something can be in order or be done in order. If something is in order, it is organized or tidy. If you do something in order, you do it in an ordered sequence. If you need to get something in order, you need to organize it. Here are two examples of this usage: “You need to get your life in order”; “I got my house in order over the weekend.” The first example is a bit dramatic, but it advises someone to organize and improve their messy life. The second example means I cleaned my house over the weekend, and my house is now clean and tidy. If you watch a series of movies in their proper sequence (Superman, Superman 2, Superman 3…), then you watch the movies “in order.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can specify the type of order things are organized in. For example: “in alphabetical order,” “in numerical order,” “in ascending order,” “in descending order.” You can also specify the type of order by using the phrase “in order from…to.” Here are two examples: “Please line up in order from tallest to shortest”; “The books are in order from A to Z.”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “In order to do that, you need to…” (If you want to do that, you need to do the following.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you do something in order to make someone happy, the purpose of your action is someone’s happiness. “In order to” refers to an effect. For example: “In order to travel, you need a passport.” If you have a passport (the cause of travel), you will be able to travel (the effect of having a passport). Another way to understand the usage of this phrase is by asking the question “Why?”  after the clause which doesn’t have “in order to.” For instance: “You need a passport.” “Why?” “In order to travel.” Here is another example of this: “She moved back to Brazil.” “Why?” “In order to be closer to her family.”</p>

In other words, it wasn’t good.”<br class="calibre6" />“I only told him I was worried about his health.” “In other words, you called him fat.”<br class="calibre6" />“The boss expects us to act more professional. In other words, we need to stop joking around so much at the office.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “In other words, you want me to…” (Said another way, you want me to do something that will be uncomfortable or difficult for me. This usage can also be used to clarify what someone, such as your boss, wants you to do.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase to interpret someone’s words or a situation in another way. Usually, the reinterpretation is much more direct. For instance: “Your mother is not happy with the state of your room. In other words, clean it today or you will not be allowed to see your friends this weekend.” You can use this phrase in a subsequent sentence that you say yourself, or as a response or follow-up statement to what someone else says. For example: “She thought it was strange that you gave her a dozen red roses.” “In other words, she’s not interested in me romantically.” “Bingo!”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can use this phrase to clarify what someone has told you, or to make sure you understand a particular task that has been given to you by someone. For example: “I want you to find other cleaning companies and to tell me how much they charge for their services.” “In other words, you want me to find a cheaper option than the one we have now.” “That’s right.”</span></p>

This could refer to an experience, a concert, a place, etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you meet someone in person, you are both bodily (physically) present at the meeting. You can use this phrase to talk about going to concerts and seeing a band or singer in person, as in example 1 above. (You can say “I saw her live” in this case as well.) You can also specify whether you would like to have a work meeting with someone online or in person, as in example 3 above. Example 2 is very common as well, as we often compare how things look in pictures and videos to how they look in person.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Use the hyphenated form, “in-person,” as an adjective. For example: “We had an in-person meeting.”</span></p>
			<p class="description">Another common way to say that something looks better in person than in pictures is “Pictures don’t do it justice.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “meet [someone] in person,” “see [someone or something] in person,” “visit [someone or something] in person”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It updates in real time.” (It updates instantaneously. This likely refers to a game, a website, or an app.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If something happens in real time, it happens instantaneously and during the actual time of an event. For example, video footage of a protest that is happening at the moment of recording is happening in real time because it is happening now, and the video is being shared instantaneously with those who are watching it on a television or computer.</p>
			<p class="description">News can be reported in real time. Computers can download updates in real time. You can talk with an online customer service representative in real time. A video game can generate a new environment in real time. As you can see, this phrase is often closely connected with technology, but it can be used in other contexts as well. For example: “Learning how to play soccer is very simple, but it’s much more intense when you’re playing in real time.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Use the hyphenated “real-time” for the adjective form. For example: “The app downloads real-time updates when they become available.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">This is a useful phrase in professional and academic contexts, especially in writing. If you have an office job where you need to send emails, this phrase is incredibly common. Here is one possible usage: “Dear Monica, I am writing in regard to your experience with our software.” As noted in the definition, you use “in regard to” to introduce or focus on a topic. Here is another example: “In regard to your recent request, I would be happy to help!”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Avoid the common mistake of writing “in regards to,” but know that many people use it. You wouldn’t say “with attentions to,” so you shouldn’t say “in regards to.” The correct phrase is “in regard to.”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “In spite of everything,...” (Despite everything that happened. Follow this with your opinion or feelings on the matter.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase means you do or do not do something regardless of a particular situation or person. In other words, the situation or person aren’t important because they are ignored or defied by the subject. For example: “In spite of the bad news, I had a pretty good week.” This means that even though there was bad news, I still had a good week in defiance of or regardless of the bad news. Here is a slightly more complex example: “In spite of everything, I wouldn’t have changed a thing.” This means that regardless of everything that happened, I wouldn’t have changed anything&mdash;I accept the good and the bad that happened because it was such a memorable experience.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Follow “in spite of” with a noun (“curiosity”), noun phrase (“the terrible weather”), gerund (“failing”), or object pronoun (“him/her”).</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Don’t think about it terms of…” (Do not think about it from the perspective of money, personal discomfort, difficulty, right and wrong, how it will impact you personally, etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase focuses on how things relate or pertain to something. For example: “Don’t think about this decision in terms of money. Think about it in terms of improving your child’s future.” This means not to think about the decision and how it relates or pertains to money, but to think about how it relates or pertains to your child’s future. Here is another example: “How are you doing in terms of your physical health?” This question is asking how you are doing, but it is specifically interested in your physical health. In this way, this phrase also focuses the perspective of a statement.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> A variation of this phrase, “in (adjective) terms,” allows you to be more specific about which aspect or point of view you are discussing. For example, you can discuss something in economic terms, in political terms, in financial terms, in philosophical terms, in historical terms, etc. Here is an example of this usage: “The philosopher Socrates had a significant impact on the minds of the people around him, not just in philosophical terms, but in political terms as well.” See the entry on “in a sense” for related usage (“in a philosophical sense,” “in a political sense,” etc.).</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “in terms of believability,” “in terms of economics,” “in terms of money,” “in terms of politics,” “in terms of public safety”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>in the final moment of decision or in the final result; in the final estimation or outcome; after everything/all; eventually; after everything is considered or decided, or after everything happens<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Do not confuse with: </span>“at the end” (see usage note)<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">See also:</span><span class="charoverride"> </span>“at the beginning”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“People will always demand your time and energy, but in the end, you have to decide what is best for yourself.”<br class="calibre6" />“We thought about going to see a movie, but in the end, we decided to stay at home because of the weather.”<br class="calibre6" />“We had many paint colours to choose from. We chose grey in the end.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It turned out well in the end.” (After everything happened or was decided, the final result was positive. This could refer to almost anything, such as an event, a project, an essay, etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is often used to discuss final decisions, opinions, happenings, results, or estimations. In short, final outcomes. Here are two examples: “I wanted to play Monopoly, but my sister wanted to play chess. In the end, we played chess” (final decision); “In the end, he was the best friend I had ever had” (in the final result or personal estimation). Two very common sentences with this phrase are “It is/was (not) worth it in the end” and “It doesn’t/didn’t matter in the end.” If something is “worth it,” it is beneficial or positive enough that you are willing to spend a certain amount of time, money, energy, etc., on it.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is sometimes confused with “at the end.” Note the differences in meaning and usage:</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">“in the end” = after everything happens or is decided; in the final outcome or estimation</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">“at the end” = at the final point or moment of something; in the final moments</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">Note these examples for “at the end”: “The main character dies at the end (of the book/movie/story/etc.)”; “I quit my job at the end of high school”; “They live at the end of the street”; “We’re almost at the end of the episode. There are only 5 minutes left.”</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">In some cases, both are possible but there is a subtle difference in meaning. For example, imagine you are discussing the death of a character in a book or film. The sentences “He dies at the end” and “He dies in the end” have slightly different meanings. “He dies at the end” means he dies in the final moments of the story&mdash;not at the beginning or in the middle, but at the end. “He dies in the end” means he dies after everything happens. This is the final outcome for the character. There were other possible outcomes, but this is the one the author chose in the end&mdash;after considering all available options.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be worth it in the end,” “decide to [do something] in the end,” “not matter in the end,” “turn out well/poorly in the end”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “after all of that,” “after everything,” “at last”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used to say that something was true or should have been done at the starting point of a situation; originally<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “at/from the beginning,” “at/from the outset”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Why didn’t you tell me that in the first place?” (I wish you had told me that at the beginning of this situation/conversation/etc.)<br class="calibre6" />“I didn’t want to do it in the first place.” (I never wanted to do it.)<br class="calibre6" />“We should have done that in the first place!” (This is the first thing we should have done.)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I wish I had known that in the first place.” (I wish I had had this information when we started this, when this situation began, etc. Grammar side note: Use the past perfect (had+past participle) for past wishes, as in “I wish you had told me that in the first place.”)</span></p>
			<p class="description">As you can see from the examples above, this phrase is often used to look into the past and express some level of dissatisfaction or annoyance. However, this isn’t its only application. Here are two neutral examples: “In the first place, we need to decide who is going to work on this”; “In the first place, we haven’t been fair to our partners.” In these contexts, “in the first place” is simply used as a replacement for the word “first.” When used in this way, the phrase is usually put at the beginning of a sentence.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “decide [something] in the first place,” “do [something] in the first place,” “say [something] in the first place,” “talk about [something] in the first place,” “tell [someone something] in the first place,” “want [something] in the first place”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Don’t worry about me.

I’ll wash the dishes in the meantime.”<br class="calibre6" />“Sorry, I need another 15 minutes to get my kids ready for bed. In the meantime, feel free to relax on the couch and watch some TV.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “What are you going to do in the meantime?” (What are you going to do while you wait for this event, process, person, etc.?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“While one waits” is a good way to explain and understand this idiomatic phrase. The “meantime” in this phrase refers to the time between two things. For example: “We won’t know the results until tomorrow. In the meantime, we can just hope for the best.” In this situation, we are waiting for the results of something (a test, a medical examination, etc.). While we wait for the results, the only thing we can do is hope for the best possible outcome between now and then.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The extension “in the meantime and in between time” is only used in casual speech. For instance: “I’ll be waiting for you in the meantime and in between time.” People sometimes use this extension to mean “at some point in the middle.” The most common sentence with this usage is “I’ll see you in the meantime and in between time,” which means I will see you between now and some point in the future.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “[do something] in the meantime,” “wait somewhere in the meantime”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Just in time!” (Something happened or someone arrived at the exact moment I wanted it/them or needed it/them.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">You arrive in time for something, to experience or to do something. Here are three examples: “We arrived in time to see the couple exchange their wedding vows” (We missed the beginning of the wedding); “I need to use the bathroom. I’ll be back in time for the start of the movie” (I will return early enough so I do not miss the start of the movie); “They were late to the game, but they arrived just in time to see the winning goal” (They missed the majority of the game, but arrived early enough to see the winning goal).</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> If you finish something “just in time,” you finish it shortly before or exactly when it is needed. You can also arrive exactly when you are needed for something. For instance: “Derek! Just in time! This customer has a question that only you can answer.” The sentence “You’re just in time!” is also common and means “You have arrived at the right moment!” Perhaps the person who says this wants or needs you for something, or you have arrived at the moment something important is going to begin or happen. For instance, if your friend invited you to watch a televised baseball game at their house and you arrive 2 minutes before the start of the game, your friend could say “You’re just in time!” (for the start of the game)</span></p>

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adjectival phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>having a sequence of good luck, positive results, correct answers, forward momentum, etc.; used when someone is having continued success and is likely to continue having success in the future<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “on fire”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“You’re on a roll. You’ve answered 20 questions correctly in a row.”<br class="calibre6" />“Sorry, but I can’t meet with you today. I’m on a roll with this work project right now, and I just want to keep going.”<br class="calibre6" />“Wow. She’s on a roll. She has scored 6 consecutive baskets!” (Context: a basketball game.)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m/He’s/She’s on a roll.” (I’m/He’s/She’s having consistent success right now and it is likely that this success will continue.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">When you are on a roll, you do not want to stop doing what you are doing because you have positive momentum. If someone goes to a casino and wins many games of blackjack (a card game) consecutively (or, “in a row”), they might say “I’m on a roll!” In this case, the person should probably quit when they have a certain level of success, but there are times when you just want to keep going. For example, if you are working on something, such as a personal project, and you are making good progress on it, you feel good while doing it, and you do not want to stop doing it, you are on a roll (or “rolling). With that in mind, this phrase has two main meanings:</p>
			<p class="description">I) having a sequence of individual successes (such as scoring consecutive baskets in a basketball game or winning consecutive games)</p>
			<p class="description">II) having a period of time when you are making significant progress on something and you do not want to stop working on it</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> A person who is “on a roll” is also often “in the zone,” which refers to a mental (or perhaps spiritual) state in which you are at the peak of your performance and you feel like you are difficult or impossible to stop. Athletes, writers, painters, and anyone who is engaged in a creative or personally satisfying activity can reach or be “in the zone.” This means they are fully engaged with their work/activity/etc.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be on a roll,” “stay on a roll”</span></p>

			<p class="description">This slightly formal phrase is used as a replacement for “because of,” “as a result of,” and “due to,” usually in official contexts, as in example 2 above. Here are three more examples: “On account of your contributions to the company, we are willing to offer you a generous severance package”; “We left the store on account of feeling disrespected by the staff”; “On account of your unique situation, the court has decided to drop the charges.”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m calling on behalf of [the name of a person or company].” (I’m calling as a representative of this person or company.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">You usually do or say something on behalf of someone or a group of people. This phrase is often used with the verbs “be” and “speak.” Here are two examples: “He wasn’t there, so I spoke on behalf of him”; “I am here on behalf of my brother.” The phrase “on behalf of” is often changed to “on one’s behalf.” The prior examples can also be said like this: “He wasn’t there, so I spoke on his behalf.” “I am here on my brother’s behalf.” In all of these cases, someone is representing someone and speaking for someone.</p>
			<p class="description">Sometimes, people get sick or are not able to be present at an event, so someone must represent them, usually in an official capacity. Employees also work for and represent their companies. Here are two examples of the mentioned contexts: “Dina isn’t feeling well this morning, so I’m here on her behalf”; “Good morning, sir. I am calling you on behalf of Green Financial Services. Do you have a minute to speak with me today?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> When someone is making a public speech that is honouring someone or a group of people, the phrase “On behalf of everyone here” is very common. For example: “On behalf of everyone here, I would like to say ‘thank you’ for everything you have done for this community.” This is common at weddings, birthday parties, ceremonies, etc.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be [somewhere] on [someone’s] behalf,” “on behalf of all [group name: mothers, employees, etc.],” “on behalf of everyone,” “on behalf of the community,” “speak on behalf of [someone]” “speak on [someone’s] behalf”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m on board.” (I support this and believe in this. You can depend on my support and participation in this cause/project/etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Just like you can be on board a ship, a train, or an aircraft with a group of people, you can be on board a particular cause, an objective, or a plan with a group of people. This means you all share the same goals and feelings about something. For example: “I think this is an interesting proposal, but I don’t think the accounting department will be on board with it.” Perhaps the accounting department will think the proposal is too expensive.</p>
			<p class="description">To understand this phrase better, imagine that you are on a ship and that everyone on the ship has the same goals and feelings about something. The people who are on the ship are “on board,” and those who are not on the ship are “not on board” for their own reasons.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> If someone is not on board with something, someone could try to persuade them to get on board.

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I’m on call tonight, so it’s better if I stay home in case the office needs me and I have to run to my computer.”<br class="calibre6" />“It must be hard being a doctor. They’re always on call.”<br class="calibre6" />“I’ll come with you for coffee, but I’m on call this afternoon, so I might have to leave at any moment.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m on call today/tonight/etc.” (I have to be ready to work at any time. This is often said when a person with this type of job wants to tell you they can not attend a social gathering due to their job.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Many tech support and medical jobs are on call. This means that people respond when they are needed. If no one needs them, they either do other work, or they wait to be called. Some people who work on call still go out with their friends, but with the knowledge that they might be called to work at any time.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> If you are on call and your company calls you because they need you, your company calls you in. In the passive form, you are called in or you get called in by your company. Note the examples: “Tricia had to leave immediately because she got called in by the hospital.” “Hi David. I’m sorry to bother you, but I have to call you in. We have a situation.”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>when expected; during the appropriate or expected moment<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common extensions: </span>“as if on cue,” “right on cue”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“She got dressed, then right on cue, she said she needed to use the toilet.”<br class="calibre6" />“As if on cue, my phone rang just as we entered the funeral home.”<br class="calibre6" />“Watch this. Lina is going to pretend she has no money and then she’ll ask me for 20 dollars.” “Sarah, I forgot my wallet at home. Can I borrow 20 dollars?” “What did I tell you? Right on cue.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Right on cue.” (Exactly when I expected this to happen, or when it was appropriate for this to happen. Perhaps you were talking about someone, and the moment you said the person’s name, they entered the room. “Speak of the devil” is common in this situation, too.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is usually used in a humorous way. If someone has a funny or annoying habit that is triggered in particular situations, their habit happens on cue. The idea of cues comes from theatre, where actors have to wait for certain words to be said or actions to be completed before they can continue with the next part of the performance. In this way, something that happens on cue happens when you expect it to happen or when it typically happens.</p>
			<p class="description">In example 1 above, the little girl often decides she needs to go to the toilet after she gets dressed to leave the house. This means she will have to take off her shoes and jacket, go to the bathroom, then get dressed again before she leaves the house. Her getting dressed to go out is the cue (or signal) for her to say she needs to use the bathroom. The entire situation is like a performance you have seen before, so you know what to expect.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The common extension “right on cue” is often used as a standalone response to something funny that happens. It emphasizes that something happens at exactly the moment you expect it to.</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">Like all versions of this phrase, “as if on cue” can be used at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence. It signifies that something happens in a way that feels like it was deliberate or part of a performance. Here are the three positions: “As if on cue, he started crying”; “The rain, as if on cue, started falling just as we exited the building”; “He laughed at her joke as if on cue.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “do [something] (right) on cue,” “fall (right) on cue,” “happen (right) on cue,” “speak (right) on cue”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s available on demand.” (It’s available whenever you ask for it. You can demand it and expect it at any time you wish.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is often used to talk about services. For example: “Netflix offers video on demand.” However, it can be used in any context where you are able to ask for something or have something whenever you want. For instance: “I love going to all-you-can-eat buffets. It’s food on demand!”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Use the hyphenated “on-demand” to use this phrase as an adjective. “They have an on-demand delivery service. You can order something and have it at your door in 45 minutes.”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>engaged in the act of work, or responsible for a task that was assigned; working during one’s assigned working hours (most often used by doctors, nurses, police officers, and security guards)<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Opposite:</span> “off duty”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Hi, can I call you back? I can’t talk right now. I’m on duty.”<br class="calibre6" />“Are you ever off duty? I feel like you work all the time.”<br class="calibre6" />“She had only been on duty for 15 minutes when the accident happened.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He’s/She’s on duty.” (He/She is actively working. It is not a good time to contact him/her for casual conversation.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">While there are many serious jobs, the idea of being on duty is most often reserved for doctors, nurses, police officers, and security guards. If one of these workers is on duty, they are working during their assigned working hours. If they are off duty, they are not working. Note the example: “I’m on duty at the hospital. I’ll be off duty in around 30 minutes.” This means this nurse or doctor will be finished work in around 30 minutes.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage notes:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Use the hyphenated forms “on-duty” and “off-duty” to use these phrases as adjectives. For example: “He got arrested by an off-duty police officer.”</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">This phrase can also be separated to specify the type of duty or job a person is currently responsible for. This usage is very versatile and can be used by anyone, whether they’re at work or not. First, here are a couple of work examples: “I’m on guard duty until 4:30pm”; “Jeffords, I’m going to put you on traffic duty today” (Jeffords will have to give parking and/or speeding tickets to drivers who break parking and/or speeding laws). Here are three informal examples: “Sorry, I can’t go out tonight. I’m on baby duty” (I am responsible for taking care of my baby tonight); “The party is tonight. Could you be on drink duty?” (Could you be the one responsible for providing drinks for the party?); “It’s your turn to be on toilet duty this week. I cleaned it last week” (You are responsible for cleaning the toilet this week).</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>anxious and unable to relax; worried; used to describe someone who is tense, nervous, and/or sensitive to any changes in their environment<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common extensions: </span>“a bit on edge,” “a little on edge,” “totally on edge”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Opposite, see also: </span>“at peace”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’ve been a bit on edge lately.” (Lately, I have felt anxious and unable to relax.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you feel anxious, tense, nervous, or worried, you are on edge. The physical signs of being on edge could include an increased heart rate, nervous behaviours (such as quickly tapping your foot on the ground), and tense muscles. A person who is on edge is unable to relax. This is not a positive state, but sometimes it is unavoidable if we receive some scary news about a family member, or if we feel that we are in danger.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can be on edge about something. For instance: “She is on edge about her driving exam.”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>without stopping or ending; continuously without any interruptions; non-stop<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variation:</span> “without end”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“We talked for hours on end.”<br class="calibre6" />“It has been raining for days on end.”<br class="calibre6" />“Sometimes, he would not talk to me for weeks on end.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “We/They talked for hours on end.” (We/They talked for several hours without stopping; we/they talked for a long time.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you do something on end, you do it continuously without any stops or interruptions. For example: “He likes to complain on end about the government.” “On end” can follow a verb (“argue on end”) or a noun (“satisfaction on end”), but it is most often used with plural time nouns, such as “hours,” “days,” “weeks,” “years,” etc. The three examples above show this usage. “Non-stop” and “without end” are good synonyms for this phrase.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Note these noun examples: “Seeing them again brought me joy on end” (or, “non-stop joy”). “We enjoyed drinks on end last night” (or, “drinks without end”). This is the least common usage of this phrase, and “non-stop + noun” is usually preferred in these cases. Verb + non-stop is also common (“party non-stop,” “dance non-stop,” etc.).</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “for days on end,” “for hours on end,” “for weeks on end,” “for years on end,” “party on end,” “talk on end,” “work on end”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adjectival phrase, slang</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>producing incredibly positive results and sustaining positive momentum for a period of time; being incredibly successful at what one is doing for a period of time<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common extension:</span> “on fire right now”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “on a roll”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“That’s his fourth goal in fifteen minutes! He’s on fire! No one can stop him!”<br class="calibre6" />“That game has sold over 2 million copies this year. It’s on fire right now.”<br class="calibre6" />“Roberta has convicted 3 criminals this month. She’s on fire at the moment.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He’s/She’s/They’re on fire right now.” (He’s/She’s/They’re producing incredibly positive results right now, and it does not feel like anyone can stop him/her/them.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Someone who is on fire is difficult to stop and easy to notice. See example 1 above for this usage. However, it’s not only people who can be on fire. A company can be on fire (“They made a lot of money last month, and their popularity is increasing. They’re on fire”). An industry or market can be on fire (“The real estate market is on fire. You can make a lot of money by selling houses right now”). Even a consumer item can be on fire (“That t-shirt’s on fire right now. Everyone is buying one”). If someone or something is producing incredibly positive results and it does not feel like anyone or anything can stop them, they are on fire. In the case of celebrities, consumer items, and trends, someone or something that is successful and extremely popular during a particular period of time can also be on fire.</p>
			<p class="description">Finally, when someone or something is on fire, the expectation is that the state is temporary, as it is impossible to sustain a superlative level of performance, success, and/or popularity for an infinite amount of time. For example: “She was on fire in 2019, but not as many people talk about her music today.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage notes:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can use this phrase to give someone positive validation or encouragement by saying “You’re on fire right now!” If someone makes a series of funny jokes, you can also use this comment, or use it sarcastically if someone makes a series of mistakes or foolish blunders.</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">The adjective “hot” can also be used in the same idiomatic way in most cases. For example: “The real estate market is hot right now.” “That t-shirt is hot this month.” In addition, the word “fire” can be used colloquially to mean that something is of really high quality. For example: “This song is fire!”; “That movie was fire!”; “Wow! Your outfit is fire today!” Note that this usage is different than something or someone who is “on fire.” </span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">Finally, there is an older usage for “on fire.” If someone is “on fire,” they are full of passion, excitement, and enthusiasm. For example: “He’s on fire with passion”; “Did you hear her speech? She was on fire in front of that microphone.” This usage is not as popular today, but is still used.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be on fire with excitement,” “be on fire with enthusiasm,” “be on fire with passion”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related words and phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “hot,” “on a hot streak”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I don’t have one on hand.” (I do not have one that is immediately available to me.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you have something on hand, it is close to you and able to be taken, bought, or used immediately. You can ask a shop owner if they have something specific on hand, meaning that they have it available for purchase (ex: “Sorry, we don’t have any on hand. Come back later”).</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m on hold.” (I am waiting for the person on the other end of the phoneline to return, or I am waiting to be transferred.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you ever call a company, especially for customer support, it is likely you will be put on hold at some point. This means the person you are speaking to needs to explore your situation or needs to input a lot of information on to their computer system. If you are on hold, you can not hear the other person. This is also common when your call is being transferred to another department and/or person in the company.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The verb “hold” (by itself) is very common in this context as well. Note the examples: “Please hold”; “Thank you for holding”; “Could you hold for a minute?” The last example is usually said as “Could I put you on hold for a minute?”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be on hold,” “place [someone] on hold,” “put [someone] on hold”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It’s on hold.” (It is delayed or paused at the moment. I probably do not know when it will continue.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you delay or pause your plans, you put your plans on hold. Often, we do not know when this state will end, but sometime we can clarify when we expect it to end by using “until.” For example: “Your final grades are on hold until the school finishes its investigation.” If you tell someone that something is on hold, they might ask “Why?” or “Until when?” You might have to put vacation plans on hold because of a family emergency, an international incident, or something else.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Something can also be “on hold” if someone is reserving it for you and not allowing others to take it. For instance: “We can put the item on hold for you for 48 hours. After that, we will sell it to someone else.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be on hold,” “put [something] on hold”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He/She did it on purpose.” (He/She meant to do that. It was not an accident.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you do something on purpose, you mean or intend to do it&mdash;you decide to do it and then actually do it. This is the opposite of doing something by accident. Note the conversation: “Did you do that on purpose?” “No, I did it by accident.” People often question the motives of others, and the idea of doing something on purpose is usually associated with choosing to do something which causes harm. Note the collocations for more examples.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The verb “mean” is synonymous with doing things on purpose.

			<p class="description">You can use this phrase as a response to someone, as in examples 1 and 2 above. You can also use it as part of your own statement, as in example 3. When used in this way, the phrase can create a dramatic effect. Here is another example of this usage: “Everyone here thinks I don’t have the experience for this job. On the contrary, I have been doing this type of work for over 7 years.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “On the contrary” can be used as a standalone response before providing more information. For instance: “Are you tired?” “On the contrary! I feel quite refreshed.” The phrase “quite the contrary” is also common in this case. A common extension is “Quite the contrary, actually.” This is a formal phrase, but when used properly, it can add a sense of gravity to your statement. Note the following example: “Why did he do that? Was it because of hatred?” “Quite the contrary, actually. He did it because of love.”</span></p>

			<p class="description">If you are on the front line, you are interacting directly with customers, clients, or people in general. In times of war, the front line refers to soldiers who are first or “at the front.” In the case of teachers, they are on the front line because they deal directly with students, compared to administrators, who (usually) do not. The prepositions at, on, and in are often used interchangeably with this phrase, as in “I work at/on/in the front line.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> The adjective form of this phrase is “frontline,” as in “She’s a frontline worker” or “He used to be a frontline employee.” You can also say that a person who is “in the front line” is “the first line of defense” or “in the line of fire.” People in the front line are vulnerable because they cannot hide behind anyone. They are the first people the public deals with.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “a frontline employee,” “a frontline worker,” “be on the front line,” “work on the front line”</span></p>

			<p class="description">A person who is on the go is always in motion. A common context for this phrase is when you decide to eat something or to buy something to eat while you are travelling. For example: “I’ll eat on the go”; “I’ll get something to eat on the go.” In the case of buying food, this is connected to ordering something for takeout, or “to go.” Here is a common social exchange with this usage: “Will that be for here or to go?” “I’ll take it to go, please.” (Context: a restaurant.)</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="charoverride2">Usage note: In addition to being on the go, you can also get on the go. If you say “Let’s get on the go,” you mean “Let’s move.

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>at risk; used when something is wagered in a bet, when something can be won or lost, or when something is at risk</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“You need to fix this. Your job is on the line!”<br class="calibre6" />“The first person to solve the puzzle wins. $200 are on the line.”<br class="calibre6" />“What do I get if I win? You need to put something on the line, too.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’ve got nothing on the line.” (I am not risking anything. This is not a dangerous situation for me. This could be used in a situation where you are involved in a competition just for pleasure.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you put something on the line, you put it at risk. You might keep it or lose it depending on the outcome of a situation. In war, soldiers put their lives on the line. If you make a bet with someone, you put something (a personal item or a specific amount of money) on the line. In a competition with a cash prize, the cash prize is what is on the line, as in example 2. This means it is able to be won or lost.</p>
			<p class="description">In example 1, a boss is telling an employee that the employee made a big mistake that could result in them losing their job. If they fix the mistake, they will keep their job. Their job is at risk, in danger, or on the line.</p>
			<p class="description">A person might say “You have nothing on the line” about someone who makes a decision that could affect others, but not themselves, or who states an unempathetic opinion. This person could be criticized in the following way: “That’s easy for you to say. You’ve got nothing on the line.” This means the person is not risking anything because they are in a comfortable or advantageous position.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage notes:</span><span class="charoverride2"> There are two other common meanings for this phrase:</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">I) to be on a call with someone (“I’m on the line with my mother”)</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">II) to be on the border of two categories (“He’s on the line between madness and genius”)</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “lay it on the line,” “money on the line,” “on the line between [something and something],” “put [something] on the line,” “reputation on the line”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-282"></a>on the one hand…on the other hand</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrases</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used to contrast two things, positions, topics, arguments, opinions, situations, beliefs, etc.<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variation:</span> “On one hand…On the other hand”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“On the one hand, he’s a great worker. On the other hand, he’s a bully.”<br class="calibre6" />“On the one hand, they make great products. On the other hand, they pay their workers incredibly low wages.”<br class="calibre6" />“On the one hand, I want to support you. On the other hand, you’re making it really difficult to do that because of how you’re acting.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “On the other hand,...” (Used to contrast something that someone else has said. For example: “We have been together for 5 years. He has been a good boyfriend”; “On the other hand, he just cheated on you and you should break up with him.”)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“On the one hand” introduces one side of a topic, and “on the other hand” provides a contrast. This does not always mean that the two sides are opposites or that one is negative and one is positive. For example: “On the one hand, I really want a hamburger for lunch today. On the other hand, I just had a hamburger for dinner yesterday.” This person is conflicted about their situation. “On the one hand” and “on the other hand” are about perspective and considering different sides of things.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “On the other hand” can be used without “on the one hand.” Note the situation: “I have $200 and I’d like to buy some new clothes. On the other hand, I should probably just use the money to buy groceries.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “in contrast,” “in one respect…in another respect,” “in one way…in another way,” “looked at one way…looked at another way”</span></p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	Use this phrase to talk about something you want or need. (Ex: “On the one hand, I need new shoes. On the other hand, I want new skates.”)</p>
			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-283"></a>on the run</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adjectival phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>in a position where one is trying to escape or hide, especially from authorities<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common extension:</span> “on the run from [someone or something]”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“He’s on the run from the police.”<br class="calibre6" />“They escaped prison 2 weeks ago and have been on the run ever since.”<br class="calibre6" />“They’re on the run from a terrorist organization.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “He’s/She’s on the run.” (He/She is trying to escape or hide from someone or something.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If a person is on the run, they do not wish to be caught or found. While this phrase is often associated with criminals who are trying to escape the police, as in examples 1 and 2, it can also be used to describe someone who is trying to escape from a dangerous situation or a dangerous group, as in example 3. A person can be on the run from war, danger, etc. This is a reality for some people in the world, and it is also something you will often hear in news reports, books, and films.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “have [someone] on the run,” “on the run from authorities,” “on the run from danger,” “on the run from the law,” “on the run from the police,” “on the run from [someone],” “on the run from terrorism,” “on the run from war”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “in retreat,” “on the loose,” “running away”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold1">2.</span><span class="italic">adverbial phrase</span> while one is hurrying, rushing, or busy<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “on the go”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I ate lunch on the run.”<br class="calibre6" />“He’s always on the run.”<br class="calibre6" />“I’ll call you on the run.” (I will call you while I am engaged in my activities.)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’ll eat it on the run.” (I will eat it while I am travelling between places by car, public transportation, or on foot, or while I am working or engaging in another activity.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This usage is synonymous with “on the go.” It is common to talk about eating something or calling someone on the run. When we do something on the run, we do it while we are engaged in another activity, such as travelling from one place to another. “On the go” is slightly more common.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “call [someone] on the run,” “eat [something] on the run,” “have breakfast/lunch/dinner on the run”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “do [something] in the middle of an activity/event/etc.”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-284"></a>on the spot</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>in the moment; spontaneously and immediately; often used when someone is placed in a position where they must contribute an opinion, or perform in an expected way in front of someone without any preparation</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“The boss asked me to recite my presentation on the spot.”<br class="calibre6" />“I don’t like being put on the spot.”<br class="calibre6" />“He started singing on the spot.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Don’t put me on the spot.” (Do not ask me to answer this or perform this in the moment.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If someone puts you on the spot, they put you in a position where they expect you to respond to something or to perform something immediately. Note the following exchange: “You’re the coordinator of the department. Can you tell me how many times Tina has arrived late to work this year?” “Not on the spot, but I can find the information if you give me a few moments.” In this case, the coordinator’s boss put the coordinator on the spot. He/She asked for information to be given at the moment of speaking.</p>
			<p class="description">To better understand this phrase, imagine that the person who is on the spot has a single light shining on them, like an actor on a stage. If someone puts you on the spot, they push you into a position where everyone can see you and where you are expected to say or do something. Most people do not enjoy being put on the spot. In fact, one of the most common statements with this phrase is “I hate to put you on the spot, but…” In this case, the person speaking knows they are putting the listener in a bad position, but they still want to ask them to say or do something.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “answer on the spot,” “ask a question on the spot,” “be on the spot,” “be put on the spot,” “perform on the spot,” “sing on the spot”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be in the spotlight,” “here and now,” “then and there”</span></p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	Are you comfortable being put on the spot?</p>
			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-285"></a>on time</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adverbial phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>arriving or happening at the correct or expected time; not late; on schedule<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Do not confuse with, see also:</span> “in time”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“She never arrives on time. She’s always late.”<br class="calibre6" />“We stopped being friends because he was never on time for anything.”<br class="calibre6" />“The concert didn’t start on time because the drummer was late.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Please arrive on time.” (Please arrive at the time I expect you to arrive.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you arrive neither late nor early for something, you arrive on time. Trains, buses, and other modes of public transportation typically run on specific schedules. If a train arrives at a station when it is supposed to arrive, it arrives on time. If it doesn’t, someone might say “The train has arrived early,” or “The train is late.” Most companies expect their employees to arrive and start work on time. If you do not start your job when you are expected to start it, your boss might say: “You’re late. You need to start on time tomorrow. Got it?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This is different than arriving “in time,” which means you either arrive early or exactly when something is expected to happen. “In time” is also often followed by a prepositional phrase that starts with “for” to indicate what the person arrived in time for. For example: “She arrived in time for the speech.” This means she did not miss the speech, but arrived sufficiently early enough to hear it.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “arrive on time,” “be on time,” “begin on time,” “come on time,” “end on time,” “finish on time,” “start on time”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “in good time,” “on schedule,” “on the dot”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>dealing with something (a task or situation) successfully, often when it is difficult; being fully engaged with and successfully handling one’s work or responsibilities</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Could you do the dishes?” “Sure, I’m on top of it.”<br class="calibre6" />“Don’t worry about it. Our team is on top of everything.”<br class="calibre6" />“I need you to be on top of this. We can’t make any mistakes, and we need everything finished by Monday.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’m on top of it.” (I am fully engaged with it and am handling it successfully. You can also use this when someone asks for help with something, and you accept the responsibility for a particular task.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you are on top of something, you are dealing with it successfully because your attention is focused and you are doing what is expected. This phrase is often used in professional and academic contexts. For instance, a student can be on top of his/her/their homework, and an employee can be on top of a work. At home, a person can be (or not be) on top of the housework, the bills, or anything else that requires regular attention to maintain a house, an apartment, etc. You can be (or not be) on top of any task or situation that requires you to be focused and doing something.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> If someone asks you to do a specific task or to help them with something in particular, you can respond with “I’m on top of it” or “I’m on it” to accept the responsibility and to show your enthusiasm, confidence, and competence. </span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be on top of [something],” “be on top of a project,” “be on top of one’s homework,” “be on top of one’s work,” “be on top of this/that,” “stay on top of something”</span></p>

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-287"></a>on track</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">adjectival phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>progressing in a way that will likely result in success, or following a course of action that will achieve a particular result; on schedule<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common extension:</span> “on track to [do something]”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Opposite:</span> “off track”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I’m currently on track to graduate by September.”<br class="calibre6" />“We need to get back on track.”<br class="calibre6" />“The government’s plan is still on track, and the program should be successfully implemented this year.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Let’s get back on track.” (Let us return to a good schedule, or let us return the discussion to the original topic.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This phrase has two meanings. The first one is similar to “on schedule.” If you are on track, you are progressing in a way that will likely result in success, or you are progressing at the rate that is expected. The phrase can be used by itself in these case. Note three examples for more context: “The project is on track”; “We are still on track”; “Our plan is not on track.”</p>
			<p class="description">“On track” can also mean that something is progressing in a way or is following a course of action that will achieve a particular result. This can be positive or negative, and it can refer to something happening at a particular time. Here are three different examples of this usage: “He’s on track to fail the class”; “My application is on track to be accepted by the summer”; “The movie is currently on track for a September release date.” As you can see, things can be on track to do something, or on track for something.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> If someone tells you to “get on track,” they want you to start doing what you need to do to achieve a particular result. If someone tells you to “get back on track,” they want you to return to a previous course of action or to a desired schedule because something has caused you to “get/go off track.” Note the following context: “The project got/went off track last week. We need to get it back on track.”</span></p>
			<p class="description">A person can also get off track (or, “lose their train of thought”) when they’re speaking, which means they start discussing something unrelated to their original point. For example: “Sorry, I got off track for a minute. My point is…”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “(not) be on track,” “get back on track,” “get on track”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “on course,” “on pace,” “on schedule”</span></p>

			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>inappropriate and/or unacceptable; used when someone says or does something insubordinate or impertinent<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common extension:</span> “way out of line”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“The teacher’s remarks were out of line.”<br class="calibre6" />“I apologize for my actions. I was out of line.”<br class="calibre6" />“You shouldn’t be in charge.” “That’s out of line. Go take a break.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “That’s out of line.” (That is too much. You/He/She/They should not have done or said that.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Your words or your actions can be out of line. This means they cross a metaphorical line, and do not conform with or follow a particular rule or social propriety. Someone who is out of line says or does something that is not received well by others because it does not follow the expectations of a company, a society, an individual, etc. Note three more examples: “Your words were incredibly out of line”; “She checked your personal emails? That’s out of line”; “He always says things that are out of line.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Note the use of these closely Related phrases: “You crossed a line”; “You were over the line”; “Your words were uncalled for”; “You were out of order.” Finally, the emphasizing adverb “way” is common with this phrase, as in “That’s way out of line.” (Or, “That’s very out of line.”)</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “be out of line,” “speak out of line”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “It goes/fits up to...” (This is the maximum speed of the vehicle, or the maximum number of people that can fit in this space.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">What is the maximum number of people who can fit in the store? “Up to 50 people can fit in the store.” You can use any types of numbers with this phrase, including seconds, hours, or monetary values. For example: “You can make up to $100,000 per year working for that company.” This phrase can also refer to a certain level of elevation, as in example 2.</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “What are you up to?” (What are you doing?&mdash;at the moment, or in your life in general.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you are up to something, you are doing something. This phrase is most often used in the question, “What are you up to?” which means “What are you doing?” A secondary meaning for this phrase is that someone is doing or planning something secretive. Some common sentences with this usage are: “I think he’s up to something”; “She’s definitely up to something”; “Do you think she’s up to something?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Be up to” is often followed by quantifiers such as “much,” “a lot,” or “not much,” as in “I’m not up to much these days” or “They’ve been up to a lot lately.”</span></p>

			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">These are all common responses and interjections you can use in the contexts specified under each entry. Memorizing set sentences and responses is one of the best ways to increase your vocabulary and your speaking confidence and fluency in any language. Practice these responses by yourself or with a partner to boost your speaking skills.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Most of the entries in this chapter do not include common sentences, as the standalone responses usually are the common sentences. To practice these responses, read the examples, memorize the ones that stand out to you, and think of situations that would force you to respond with these sentences.</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-292"></a>As if.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used to express that something sounds highly unlikely or is actually untrue</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“She’s the best swimmer in the world.” “As if! She’s not even close.”<br class="calibre6" />“Julia said it was your fault.” “As if! You’re going to believe Julia?”<br class="calibre6" />“These jeans are worth $200.” “As if! Have you felt the material?”</p>
			<p class="description">This is a quick interjection that is often said emphatically. It is like a strong instant negative reaction because you cannot believe the person speaking to you has actually said what they have said. In short, you are saying “That’s a lie” or “I highly doubt it.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “As if” is often used as a standalone response, but it can also be used in the middle of sentences. Note the examples: “He talks to people as if he were the king of England”; “The house was incredibly quiet. It felt as if everyone had been sleeping.” In these cases, it is synonymous with “like,” but it uses conditional grammar structures.</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">You can also use “as if” in the second part of a sentence or as a response to show contrast and strong personal feelings about a situation. For instance: “My wife bought four new plates&mdash;as if we needed more plates.” In this case, you are not happy that your wife bought four new plates because you feel you do not need them. Here is one more example: “The boss said he would fix the problem.” “As if our boss has ever fixed anything.” In both of the examples above, the person saying “as if” is skeptical and maybe even sarcastic. They do not believe that something is necessary or true.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I highly doubt it.” “Yeah, right.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-293"></a>Come again?”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>“Could you repeat that?” Used when one did not hear or understand someone properly, or when one wants to confirm they heard something properly (because it sounds strange or unbelievable)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Your grandmother is going camping this weekend.” “Come again?”<br class="calibre6" />“Are you listening to me?” “Hmm? Come again? Sorry, I was distracted.”<br class="calibre6" />“He wants to sell the company.” “Wait, what? Come again?”</p>
			<p class="description">This common response is often used when you were not paying attention properly to someone, you did not hear someone well, or when someone tells you something strange or unbelievable. It is an informal way to ask someone to repeat something. It can be rude if the person who is speaking to you has spent a long time trying to explain something, but you have not been paying attention to them.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Could you run that by me one more time?” is another common question with similar usage. “Wait, what?” is used to show shock or surprise. It is sometimes said quickly and lazily, and can sound like “weiwa?”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Run that by me one more time.” “Wait, what?”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-294"></a>Come on.”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Come on! We’re going to miss the bus!”<br class="calibre6" />“We need to leave. Come on.”<br class="calibre6" />“Come on. The performance starts in an hour.”</p>
			<p class="description">If you tell someone to “come on,” you are telling them to start moving or to move quicker. In the case of moving quicker, the imperative “Hurry up” is also common. Depending on your tone, “Come on” sounds a little more encouraging and less commanding. “Hurry up” usually sounds commanding.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Hurry up.” “Let’s go.” “Let’s move.”</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">2.</span>used for encouraging someone to make a greater effort, to stop being sad or upset, or to show one’s frustration with someone’s words or actions</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“You think I’m ugly!” “Come on, Nik. That’s not what I said.” (frustration)<br class="calibre6" />“You can find another job, Jason. Come on. It’s not so bad.” (encouragement)<br class="calibre6" />“Come on, Dorothy! You can do it! You’re almost there!” (encouragement)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Come on. It’s not that bad.” (Look at this situation in a different way. It could be worse.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">In all of the examples above, “Come on” encourages some form of movement, whether physical or mental. As you can see, depending on the context, you can express your frustration with someone or something (“Come on! Why isn’t this stupid phone working?!”), or encouragement, as in examples 2 and 3 above. When you say “Come on,” your mind wants to shake the other person in some way and change their behaviour or their perspective. It’s like saying “Hey! Wake up.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Look on the bright side.” “Really?!” (frustration)</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">3.</span>used for showing one’s surprise or disbelief</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Come on! Are you serious?”<br class="calibre6" />“There’s no way that’s true. Come on.”<br class="calibre6" />“Come on. Really? You’re joking, right?” (Or, “You’re kidding, right?”)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Come on. Really?” (Are you serious? I do not believe what you are telling me.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">When you use “Come on” in this way, you are surprised or in disbelief. It’s like you are encouraging the other person to continue speaking, hoping they will tell you they are joking or trying to trick you&ndash;because what they are saying is hard for you to believe or accept. “Come on. Really?” and “Come on. Seriously?” are very common responses in these situations.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can also say “Come on. Really?” or “Come on. Seriously?” when you are frustrated with what someone has said or done. Note the following exchange: “I lost your tablet.” “Come on. Seriously?”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Are you joking/kidding?” “No way.” “Say what?”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-295"></a>Do tell.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>“Tell me more.” Used when you want someone to give you more information about a topic they have just introduced, typically because the information really interests you or the information is gossip</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Jake and Samantha broke up.” “Really? Do tell.”<br class="calibre6" />“I just told the boss I wanted more money.” “Oh! Do tell. How did it go?”<br class="calibre6" />“We had an amazing date last night.” “That sounds exciting! Do tell.”</p>
			<p class="description">Most people are interested in hearing interesting stories about other people. The phrase “Do tell” is an imperative that encourages someone to tell you more details about a topic they have introduced. This response is very common in situations where gossip is involved, as in example 1. However, if any topic interests you, you can use this phrase. Just remember that it is not typically used in serious conversations, but is a light-hearted (meaning amusing or entertaining) invitation for someone to tell you more details about a topic they have introduced.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related response:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Don’t spare any/the details.” (Tell me as many details as possible.)</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-296"></a>For sure.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>“Definitely.” “Certainly.” “Without a doubt.” Used when one is certain of something, or when one can definitely do something<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variation:</span> “That’s for sure.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Can you help me to clean the bathroom tomorrow?” “For sure.”<br class="calibre6" />“They’re going to win today.” “Oh, for sure!”<br class="calibre6" />“Can she really lift 250 pounds?” “Yes. For sure. I’ve seen her do it.”</p>
			<p class="description">You can say “yes” to a person’s request with this response. For example: “Could you help me with this?” “For sure. Just give me a second.” “For sure” means “definitely” or “without doubt.” If something is for sure, it is 100% certain. You can also show that you are extremely confident about a particular outcome, as in example 2 above.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Say “That’s for sure” when you want to strongly agree with something someone has said. This is a way of saying “That is 100% true.” For instance: “This was the best vacation we’ve ever had.” “That’s for sure.”</span></p>
			<p class="description">Other quick words and phrases are often used around “for sure.” Here are some examples of how you can respond positively to a request: “Yeah, for sure”; “For sure. No problem”; “For sure. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “One hundred percent.” “No doubt about it.” “Without a doubt.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-297"></a>Here you go”; “<a id="calibre_link-298"></a>There you go.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used when you give, send, or throw something to someone<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variation:</span> “Here you are”; “There you are.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Could you please pass me a tissue?” “Sure. Here you go.”<br class="calibre6" />“I’ll also take a pack of gum.” “No problem. There you go. Anything else?”<br class="calibre6" />“Do you need a pen? I’ve got an extra one in my bag. Here you go!”</p>
			<p class="description">Say “Here you go” when you give something to someone and place it in front of them or into their hand. The use of “Here you go” or “There you go” depends on physical and mental distance from the object. If you are in the process of giving something to someone, meaning your hand is in motion, you will probably say “Here you go.” A server at a restaurant who is placing your meal onto the table will most likely say “Here you go,” as will a bank teller who slides money from their side of the counter to your side.</p>
			<p class="description">Use “There you go” the moment you feel you have “pushed” the object away from you toward the other person. If your friend asks you to send a picture via text message, you can send the picture and say “Here you go” or “There you go” depending on how close you feel to the picture. Do you imagine yourself with the picture in your hand (“Here you go”) or do you feel that the picture is now “away” from you (“There you go”)?</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Here we go” is used when an event or course of action is about to begin. For example: “Is everyone ready to start playing? Okay! Here we go!” You can also use this when you are not directly involved in a game or event, but are simply watching it, listening to it, etc. For instance: “The political debate is about to begin in 3, 2, 1&mdash;here we go.”</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">“Here we go” is also used when someone starts doing or saying something that they have a habit of doing. Typically, this is a habit that we think is annoying, or something that we expect the person to say or do. For example: “You wouldn’t act this way if your mother had never…” “Here we go! You always have to bring my mother into every argument.”</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">Finally, “There you go” can be used synonymously with “Of course” when something happens that we expect. It is used to show our resignation or  excitement towards what has happened. Note the two examples: “My brother just took the money and ran away.” “There you go. We shouldn’t be surprised. He always does this”; “I finished in first place!” “There you go! That’s great! I knew you could do it!”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-299"></a>I got it”; “<a id="calibre_link-300"></a>Gotcha.” </p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>“I understand what you are telling me.” “I understand you.”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common abbreviated variation:</span><span class="charoverride"> </span>“Got it.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Finally, you need to put this here, and then you’re done. Got it?” “I got it.”<br class="calibre6" />“The delivery will arrive between 6 and 7 o’clock.” “Gotcha.”<br class="calibre6" />“A gerund looks like a verb but acts like a noun.” “Oh! I got it now.”</p>
			<p class="description">Grammatically, this is the informal way to say “I have it,” “I have acquired it,” or “I have got it.” In informal situations, when someone explains something to you, you can say “I got it” to mean that you understand it. You can also say “Got it” without the subject. A person who is trying to show you how to do something or explain something to you might ask “Got it?” or “You got it?” to check your understanding. When they do this, you can answer with a simple yes or no, or say “I got it,” “Got it,” or “Gotcha.” The popular negative usage of this phrase is “I don’t got it” or “Don’t got it.”</p>
			<p class="description">“I gotcha” or “Gotcha” are also popular in casual situations. They are shorter colloquial pronunciations of “I have got you,” and are other ways to say “I understand you.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can also say “I get it” in the present form to mean “I understand it” or “I understand what you are explaining to me or showing me.” The negative of this is “I don’t get it” (or, “I didn’t get it” to say you did not understand something). “I get it” and “I got it” are often used interchangeably even though they look and sound like they are using different tenses. (Remember that “I got it” is actually the grammatically incorrect form of “I have got it,” which is also present.)</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Crystal clear.” “I get what you’re saying.” “Sounds good.” “That makes sense.”</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">2.</span>“I got it.” used to say one will handle a situation or accept responsibility for a task, typically as a volunteer<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “I’m on it,” “on top of [something]”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Oh no! The oven is still on.” “Don’t worry. I got it.” (I will turn it off.)<br class="calibre6" />“Can you do this for me?” “Of course! I got it.”<br class="calibre6" />“Don’t worry about the apartment while you’re away. I got it.”</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase reassures someone that they do not have to worry about something because you are accepting responsibility for it. For instance, if your neighbours go on vacation and ask you to check their mail while they are away, you can say “No problem. I got it.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Use the related phrase “I got this” to tell others that you are confident about your ability to handle a particular situation, task, or responsibility. You can also encourage someone and show them that you believe in their abilities by saying “You got this.” For example: “You shouldn’t feel nervous about this test. You have studied all week. You got this.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I got this.” “I’m on it.” “I’m on top of it.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-301"></a>I know, right?”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>“That is true.” “I agree with what has just been said.” Used for showing that one agrees with someone<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common abbreviated variation:</span><span class="charoverride"> </span>“Right?”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Canadian variation: </span>“I know, eh?” (“eh” is pronounced “ei,” as in “hey”)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“This pizza is so delicious!” “I know, right?”<br class="calibre6" />“Today’s weather is absolutely brutal.” “I know, right?”<br class="calibre6" />“She needs to stop listening to him.” “I know, right?”</p>
			<p class="description">This quick response shows that you agree with what has just been said. To understand this response a little better, in example 1, “I know, right?” could be substituted with “Yes, it is” in regard to the deliciousness of the pizza. Example 2 could be substituted with “Yes, it is,” and example 3 could be substituted with “Yes, she does.” “I know, right?” shows emphatic agreement. You can use it to agree with a negative statement as well. For example: “People shouldn’t work 5 days a week.” “I know, right?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can also simply say “Right?” for the same effect. For example: “That was such an amazing show.” “Right?!” In both cases, “I know, right?” and “Right?” you are happy that someone has expressed your thoughts or feelings before you did.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Ain’t that the truth?” (American for “Is that not the truth?”) “I was just going to say that.” “I was thinking the same thing.” “You got that right.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-302"></a>I think so.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>“I think that is the case.” “I think that is true.” Used when one is relatively confident that something is (or is not) true or the case<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Opposite:</span> “I don’t think so.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Didn’t they get married last year?” “I think so.”<br class="calibre6" />“Do you think these shoes will fit him?” “I don’t think so.”<br class="calibre6" />“Will the room be painted before Friday?” “I think so.”</p>
			<p class="description">This is a common response to yes/no questions when you are not 100% certain of the answer, but you have enough knowledge or information to think (or believe) that something is (or is not) true. Here is another example of this usage: “Isn’t Sydney the capital of Australia?” “I don’t think so. I always forget the actual capital, though” (The capital of Australia is Canberra). Here is another context: “Are the cookies ready?” “I think so. I’ll check the oven.” As you can see, if you are relatively confident or if you believe that something is (or is not) true, you can use “I think so” (or, “I don’t think so”).</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I believe so.” “I hope so.” “He/She/It should be.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-303"></a>I’m on it.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for indicating that one will handle or be responsible for a particular task or situation<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common abbreviated variation:</span> “On it!”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “on top of [something]”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Who’s going to write the final report for our team?” “Don’t worry. I’m on it.”<br class="calibre6" />“Could someone turn down the air conditioning in here?” “On it!”<br class="calibre6" />“We’re behind schedule on this project, so I need you to get on it.” “No problem, boss. I’m on it.”</p>
			<p class="description">Use this response when someone directly asks you if you can handle a particular task or responsibility. For instance: “Could you go to the store to buy some carrots?” “No problem. I’m on it.” When someone says they’re “on it,” they typically act almost immediately. In this case, the person probably went to buy the carrots shortly after promising to do so. When someone says “I’m on it,” it is similar to them saying “You can trust me to do this.” Someone who is “on it” acts independently and feels confident that they can accomplish a particular task or handle a particular situation or responsibility.</p>
			<p class="description">This response can also be used in a group situation. For example, if you are planning a party and you ask your friends to help you, you might ask “Who can bring potato chips?” The person who responds “I’m on it” (or, simply, “On it!”) is offering to be responsible for the potato chips.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can also “get on it,” as in example 3 above. This means you take or accept responsibility for handling something. Here are 3 more common sentences with “get on it”: “I’ll get on it as soon as I can”; “I can get on it starting tomorrow” (I am busy today, but I can become involved in this starting tomorrow); “I just got on it today. I need more time.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I’ll handle it.” “I’ll get on it.” “I’m on top of it.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-304"></a>Kind of”; “<a id="calibre_link-305"></a>Sort of.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>“In some ways.” “In some respects.” “Not exactly, but partially.” Used for saying that something is partially true or the case<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common colloquial pronunciations:</span> “Kinda”; “Sorta.”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “in a sense,” “in a way”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“You look a little sad. Didn’t you have a good time?” “Kind of.”<br class="calibre6" />“Were you disappointed by the movie?” “Yeah. Sort of.”<br class="calibre6" />“I thought the two of you were related.” “We are. Kind of.”</p>
			<p class="description">You can be kind of disappointed. A wall can be sort of green. A car can be kind of old. In all of these cases, the idea is that things are not exactly true or the case, but that there is some truth to them. If a friend asks you to stay late at a party, you can say “Actually, I’m kind of (or ‘sort of’) tired.” This means you are partially tired and you probably want to go home.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Sort of” and “kind of” can be used interchangeably. In addition to using these phrases with adjectives and verbs (“I kind of want that”), you can use them with nouns. For example: “She’s kind of a philosopher.” This means she is not exactly a philosopher, but perhaps she sounds like a philosopher sometimes. If you bake a cake that looks bad, someone can say “It’s sort of a cake.”</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">The phrases “some sort of” or “some kind of” are also common. This means that someone or something is a particular type of something, but you are not sure about their exact status. For instance: “He’s some kind of/sort of teacher.” This means you know he is a teacher, but you do not know which subject he teaches, or you are not sure what his teaching credentials are.</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">Finally, you can use this phrase sarcastically or to make a situation feel less serious. For example, you can tell a person “That’s kind of wrong” when you mean “That is absolutely wrong.” If someone says “You’re sort of out of time,” they usually mean “You have no more time remaining.” Using “sort of” in this way softens the news, or it can be used sarcastically as well.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> (all “kind of” uses can be replaced with “sort of”) “kind of helped,” “kind of it,” “kind of poor,” “kind of rich,” “kind of right,” “kind of tired,” “kind of true,” “kind of wrong,” “some kind of answer,” “some kind of danger,” “some kind of response”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “a type of,” “in a manner of speaking”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-306"></a>More or less.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>approximately; about; close to; to a certain extent or degree<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “Kind of”; “Sort of.” “Pretty much.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Did your job interview go well?” “More or less.”<br class="calibre6" />“Are they finished working on that?” “More or less.”<br class="calibre6" />“Can he survive in a Portuguese-speaking environment?” “More or less.”</p>
			<p class="description">Sometimes, we want to use imprecise language. If something is not exactly true or the case, but it is close to being true or the case, it is more or less true or the case. A person can say “I’m more or less done.” This means they have done as much as they can and probably don’t intend to do more. You can use this as a standalone response when you want to say that something is close to being true, or is approximately true. Note the examples above.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “More or less” is slightly more precise or closer to the truth than “kind of”/”sort of.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “more or less done/finished,” “more or less the case,” “more or less ready,” “more or less true”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “give or take (a few days, an hour, a few minutes, etc.)”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-307"></a>No way!”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>“I don’t believe it!”; used to express shock, surprise, disbelief, and/or an impossibility</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Lucas was the one who did it.” “No way!”<br class="calibre6" />“She paid over $100 for that shirt.” “No way!”<br class="calibre6" />“Her parents kicked her out of the house.” “No way!”</p>
			<p class="description">This is an emphatic response to show that you are shocked, surprised, or in disbelief because of what someone has just told you. It is similar to saying “Wow! I don’t believe it.” Another way to think of this response is “There is zero possibility that what you have just told me is true.” With this in mind, you can also use “no way” in the middle of a sentence, especially with the structure “There’s no way,” as in the following examples: “There is no way they can win” (They can’t win); “There was no way he had good intentions” (He didn’t have good intentions in his heart when he did that); “There is no way she’s telling the truth” (I strongly believe she is not telling the truth).</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can also use “no way” to mean there is no path, no course, or no road to arrive at a certain location or outcome. This is typically used with “There is no way” or subject + have/has + no way. Note the examples and structures: “There is no way for them to win” (It is impossible for them to win); “There is no way into the city” (All the roads into the city are inaccessible); “We have no way to contact her” (We cannot contact her because we do not have her contact information, or maybe she is somewhere without mail service or a wi-fi signal). Note the possible structures here:</span></p>
			<p class="description">no way + to + base verb (“no way to know”)</p>
			<p class="description">no way + for + noun or pronoun + to + base verb (“no way for him to go”)</p>
			<p class="description">no way + preposition (“no way into the program”)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “no way into [somewhere or something],” “no way to enter,” “no way to escape,” “no way to get in,” “no way to go,” “no way to know,” “no way to win”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “no chance,” “not a chance”</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">2.</span>an emphatic way to say “No” to a command or request</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Can I borrow $500?” “No way. You still owe me $100.”<br class="calibre6" />“Clean this room right now!” “No way! I didn’t make this mess!”<br class="calibre6" />“He wants you to apologize.” “No way. I didn’t do anything wrong.”</p>
			<p class="description">If someone asks you or tells you to do something, and you have a strong reason for saying “No,” you can say “No way,” as in the examples above. In these cases, you strongly refuse to do something. Maybe it is impossible for you to do it, but it is more likely you simply do not want to complete the request or command for personal reasons, or because you are stubborn.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “no chance,” “not a chance”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-308"></a>Not a chance.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for saying there is no possibility of something happening or being true<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variations:</span> “no chance,” “no chance in hell,” “not a chance in hell”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “No way.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Do you think he knows the answer?” “Not a chance.”<br class="calibre6" />“Will you forgive him?” “Not a chance.”<br class="calibre6" />“Are we going to get there in time?” “Not a chance.”</p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase when you feel strongly about the impossibility of something. In this way, it is a stronger way to say “No” to someone. Two common contexts for this are denying requests (“Could I borrow your phone?” “Not a chance”),  and speculating about the possibility of something, as in example 1 above. “No chance” and “No way” can be used in the same way.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> To make this phrase stronger, use the colloquial variation “no chance in hell.” Note the example: “Are you going to call him back?” “No chance in hell.” In this case, you feel very strongly about the negation.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “No way, no how.” “Not (even) if you paid me.” “Not in a million years.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-309"></a>Not at all.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>not to any extent or degree; “No.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Do you have a good relationship with him?” “Not at all.”<br class="calibre6" />“Is he allergic to anything?” “Not at all.”<br class="calibre6" />“Have you been practicing your French lately?” “Not at all.”</p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase when you want to emphasize a negative case, as in the examples above. If “not at all” had a numerical equivalent, it would be zero. For instance: “Do you like horror movies?” “Not at all.” This means I do not like horror movies to any extent or degree&mdash;I receive zero enjoyment and/or have zero interest in horror movies.</p>
			<p class="description">You can also use “not at all” in the middle of sentences, typically before adjectives. For example: “I am not at all satisfied”; “Phillip was not at all disappointed with the outcome.” In these cases, however, it is more common to wrap “not at all” around an adjective or longer phrase, as in the following examples: “I am not satisfied at all”; “Phillip was not disappointed with the movie at all.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> As a substitute for “You’re welcome,” this phrase is also similar to “No problem” and “Don’t worry about it.” Note the examples: “Thanks again for paying for dinner.” “Not at all”; “Thank you for your help.” “Not at all.”</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">Finally, it is common to emphasize the negative quality of something with the phrase “not good at all.” For example: “This song isn’t good at all.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “not bad at all,” “not good at all,” “not satisfied at all”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related response:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Not in any way, shape, or form.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-310"></a>Not by a long shot.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>not by a wide margin; used for indicating that something is far from finished, true, or the case</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Wait. I thought you grew up here.” “Not by a long shot. I grew up on the other side of the country.”<br class="calibre6" />“So, you’re saying she’s not the best candidate?” “Not by a long shot.”<br class="calibre6" />“Are we done yet?” “Not by a long shot.”</p>
			<p class="description">While the phrase “by a long shot” can be used in affirmative cases, it is most often used in the negative, and as a standalone response. “Not by a long shot” means that something has a long way to go, and that the target is very far away. This can be the truth (example 1), the case (example 2), or simply the level of incompletion (example 3). When you use this phrase, think of a massive distance between what someone says and what is actually the case. In example 1, you can also simply imagine a physical distance.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> As mentioned, “by a long shot” can be used in affirmative sentences. This is most common in some variation of the sentence “It’s a long shot.” Note these three examples: “It’s a long shot, but it’s possible”; “They can still win, but it’s going to be a long shot”; “I asked for an extra meal for free, but they said no. I knew it was a long shot, but I had to try.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “In no way, shape, or form.” “No way, no how.” “Not in any way, shape, or form.” “Nothing could be further from the truth.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-311"></a>Of course.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used to show emphatic agreement, or to give emphatic permission; absolutely; definitely; “Yes. Obviously.”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Opposite:</span> “Of course not.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“May I sit here?” “Yes. Of course.”<br class="calibre6" />“Do you think this plan will work?” “Of course.”<br class="calibre6" />“Could I borrow your pen for a second?” “Yeah. Of course.”</p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase when it is not a problem for you to give permission to someone, or when you want to show emphatic agreement or confidence, as in example 2. Another way to think about this phrase is to say “That is not even a question!” Basically, if the state or outcome of something seems obvious to you, you can use “of course.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “without a doubt,” “without question”</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">2.</span>used for saying that something is obvious, or to introduce an obvious or expected point; obviously; “That is clear.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“We will need at least three more people for this.” “Of course.”<br class="calibre6" />“Everyone will need to arrive at least 10 minutes early.” “Of course.”<br class="calibre6" />“Of course, dinner will only be served once the bride and groom arrive.”</p>
			<p class="description">Examples 1 and 2 are similar to the first meaning above. However, note that you can use “of course” as a standalone response or as part of a sentence, as in example 3. Here are a few more examples of this usage: “We will of course pay for our own tickets”; “Of course I’ll do it!”; “Yes, I can help you. Of course, I will need a few minutes to arrange some things first.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “without a doubt,” “without question”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-312"></a>Pretty much.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used to say that something is approximately or basically the case; close to; “Basically.”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common casual extensions: </span>“Pretty much. Yeah.” “Yeah. Pretty much.”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “More or less.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Are you saying you don’t like him?” “Yeah. Pretty much.”<br class="calibre6" />“Their business failed because their prices were too high.” “Pretty much.”<br class="calibre6" />“Has she not done it because she doesn’t care?” “Pretty much. Yeah.”</p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase to say that something is approximately or basically the case. Note another example: “Are you ready to leave?” “Pretty much.” If something is close to being the case, but is not 100% the case, you can use “pretty much” to describe this situation. For these reasons, it is interchangeable with “more or less.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> In addition to being a standalone response, “pretty much” can be used in the middle of sentences. It can be followed by an adjective, preposition, noun, pronoun, or noun phrase. Here are some examples: “I’m pretty much done”; “We’re pretty much in”; “That is pretty much the case”; “There are more details to the story, but that’s pretty much it”; “Arcade Fire are pretty much the best band in the world.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “pretty much done,” “pretty much it,” “pretty much true”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “just about”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-313"></a>Right on!”</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">slang</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for showing strong approval, support, or encouragement</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“They have approved my application.” “Right on! I knew they would!”<br class="calibre6" />“She’s going to quit her job tomorrow.” “Right on. They don’t deserve her.”<br class="calibre6" />“They sold their farm for twice the price.” “Right on!”</p>
			<p class="description">This is a colloquial way to say “That’s great” or “I approve of this.” It is typically used when speaking to friends or people you are familiar and comfortable with.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase can also </span><span class="charoverride2">be used to mean “exactly.” Note the example: “Guess how much this t-shirt costs.” “I don’t know. $25?” “Right on!” You can also use the common variation “right on the money.” In addition to guesses about numbers, both phrases can be used to say that someone’s assessment of a situation is accurate. For instance: “You said the reasons for the company’s changes were due to not having enough employees. You were right on (the money) when you said that.” </span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocation:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “right on the money” (see usage note for meaning and context)</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related response:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “All right!”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-314"></a>So what?”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for saying that something is not a big deal and that it should not be treated with suspicion, contempt, or objection<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variation:</span> “So?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“She had fish with red wine!” “So what? Maybe she really likes red wine.”<br class="calibre6" />“He isn’t coming to the wedding.” “So what? He can do what he wants.”<br class="calibre6" />“Rena spent all of her money on shoes.” “So what?”</p>
			<p class="description">If you do not see or understand why something is significant, you can say “So what?” We use this response when we think that something does not matter or when we think it is not important. In short, it is not a big deal. We can also use it when we do not think something is relevant to us. This response is also often shortened to “So?” Note the example: “Teddy wore a white shirt today.” “So?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> While we often use this response to say “That doesn’t sound important or significant to me,” we can also use it to say “I don’t understand why that’s important. Could you tell me more?” The above example about Teddy wearing a white shirt could have this usage.</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">We can also use this response when we want others to think that we do not care about a situation&mdash;even when we do. In some cases, we use “So?” or “So what?” as a defensive response. For instance: “Dana, you haven’t taken a shower in 7 days.” “So what?!” Dana is basically saying “Why do you care? It’s my life, and I can make my own decisions.” She doesn’t see the problem. In this case, we use “So what?” defensively when we hear criticisms about ourselves or others that we don’t want to hear, but maybe need to hear.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I don’t see the problem/issue.” “What’s the big deal?” “What’s your point?” “Who cares?” “Why do you care?” “Why does it matter?”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-315"></a>Tell me about it.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for showing complete agreement with someone; “Absolutely”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “You can say that again.” “You’re telling me.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Life was so much simpler when we were kids.” “Yeah. Tell me about it.”<br class="calibre6" />“Trisha looks much happier these days.” “Tell me about it! I thought I was the only one who noticed.”<br class="calibre6" />“The weather this weekend has been incredible.” “Tell me about it!”</p>
			<p class="description">When someone says something that creates a strong desire in you to say “Yes!” to agree with them, you can say “Tell me about it.” This phrase is used for both, positive and negative situations. When we use it for negative situations, we typically say it in an unhappy or sarcastic tone. Here is an example showing this: “Terry is a horrible boss.” “Yeah. Tell me about it.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> We do not usually want people to tell us more about the situation when we use this phrase, but we can continue the conversation with it if we would like. For instance: “The team played incredibly well today.” “Tell me about it. Did you know they hired a physical trainer for all the players?” “No. Really?”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Ain’t that the truth?” “I know what you mean.” “No doubt about it.” “That’s for sure.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-316"></a>Why not?”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for questioning why something is not permitted, true, or possible, or to show approval or agreement of a proposed course of action<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common colloquial variation:</span> “Why the heck not?” “Why the hell not?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“You can’t do that.” “Why not?” (Why is this not permitted?)<br class="calibre6" />“What do you think? Should we do it?” “Sure. Why not? Let’s do it.”<br class="calibre6" />“Do you want to go out with us tonight?” “You know what? Why not? I’ve spent too much time indoors lately.”</p>
			<p class="description">When someone wants us or asks us to do something, the answer “Why not?” can have a few different sentiments. We use “Why not?” when we are tired and do not want to argue strongly in the opposite direction. We can also use it emphatically to show our agreement or approval of something. Finally, we use “Why not?” when we are curious and when we want to see what will happen if we follow the proposed course of action. For example: “I want you to visit the art gallery with me. I promise you’ll like it. What do you say?” “Why not? It sounds interesting.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> You can use “Why not + base verb” to make a suggestion. Here are three examples: “Why not have dinner with your parents tonight?”; “Why not call him in the morning?”; “Why not get a new one?” This is synonymous with “Why don’t you/we/they/etc. + base verb?”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I can’t see any reason not to.” “I don’t see why not.” “What’s the worst that could happen?” “You’ve twisted my arm.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-317"></a>You can say that again.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for showing complete agreement with someone; “Absolutely”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">See also:</span> “Tell me about it.” “You’re telling me.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“This is an awful situation for everybody.” “You can say that again.”<br class="calibre6" />“Antonio isn’t in a good mood today.” “You can say that again.”<br class="calibre6" />“Choi Min-jeong is an incredible skater.” “You can say that again.”</p>
			<p class="description">This response is synonymous with “Tell me about it.” It shows strong agreement because you are inviting the person to say the same thing again. Of course, you do not really want the other person to repeat their sentence. You simply mean “Yes, that is true and I completely agree with you.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Ain’t that the truth?” “I know what you mean.” “No doubt about it.” “That’s for sure.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-318"></a>You’re kidding”; “<a id="calibre_link-319"></a>You’re joking.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for showing disbelief, surprise, shock, or skepticism toward what someone has said or done<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “No way.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“My 7-year-old daughter ate 3 hamburgers for breakfast.” “You’re kidding.”<br class="calibre6" />“I got this for free.” “You’re joking.”<br class="calibre6" />“They won the lottery!” “No way! You’re kidding!”</p>
			<p class="description">If someone is kidding or joking, they are not being serious. The response “You’re kidding” or “You’re joking” is used when we are not sure if someone is telling us the truth, either because they have a history of sarcasm and trickery, or because their news is difficult to believe. We can express shock, disbelief, surprise, or skepticism with this response.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Are you joking?” and “Are you kidding?” are very common responses as well.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Are you joking?” “Are you kidding?” “Are you kidding me?” “No kidding.” “You’re kidding me.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-320"></a>You’re telling me.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for telling someone that you are already aware of something and/or that you are in agreement with them<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “Tell me about it.” “You can say that again.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I hate this rainy weather.” “You’re telling me. I got wet during my break.”<br class="calibre6" />“Wow. That looks really nice on you.” “You’re telling me! I look great!”<br class="calibre6" />“This movie is too long.” “You’re telling me. I’m ready to fall asleep.”</p>
			<p class="description">Use this informal response to tell someone that you agree with what they have just said because you have personal experience with or awareness of it as well. For instance: “This computer is so slow.” “You’re telling me. It took me 15 minutes to check my email.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Ain’t that the truth?” “I know what you mean.” “No doubt about it.” “That’s for sure.”</span></p>
			<p id="calibre_link-321" class="heading-l"><a id="calibre_link-322" class="calibre2"></a>FILLERS AND TRANSITIONS</p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">The words and phrases below are all extremely common in English conversations all over the world. They are used to begin or to fill a gap in a conversation, to provide relevant information, or to change the topic. Learning the language in this chapter will make a significant impact on the fluency of your speech, and on the confidence you exhibit in conversation.</span></p>
			<p class="body-text"><span class="italic">Practice these fillers and transitions by reading the example sentences and thinking of your own contexts and original sentences.</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-323"></a>Anyway” (”at any rate,” “<a id="calibre_link-324"></a>in any case,” “<a id="calibre_link-325"></a>in any event”)</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for changing the topic or returning to a previous topic</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“My weekend was good. Thanks for asking. Anyway, are you busy today?”<br class="calibre6" />“I need to buy some groceries later. Anyway, you were talking about your mom visiting you tomorrow?”<br class="calibre6" />“I can’t wait to get home and take a hot bubble bath.” “Okay. Anyway…”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Anyway, what were we talking about before?”</span></p>
			<p class="description">If someone says something that makes you feel uncomfortable, awkward, bored, or uninterested, you can shift the focus of the conversation by simply saying “Anyway.” If you use the word as a standalone response, the person or people whom you are speaking to should understand that you want to change the topic. Example 3 above shows this usage. You can also use “anyway” to change the topic, as in example 1, or to return to a previous topic, as in example 2.</p>
			<p class="description">In all of the cases above, “anyway” is used to shift the focus of the conversation from one thing to another. Here is one more example of changing the focus of the conversation: “Julian! Nice to see you! Anyway, can I help you with anything?”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">2.</span>used for indicating that you want or need to end the conversation</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Anyway, it was nice to see you. Good luck with everything!”<br class="calibre6" />“Anyway, I need to get back to work, so I’ll talk to you another time, okay?”<br class="calibre6" />“Anyway, the store closes in 15 minutes, so I should go. Take care.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Anyway, I should get going.” (I should go.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you do not know how to elegantly end a conversation, use “anyway” followed by your reason for ending the conversation, or by saying something polite, as in example 1. Here are a few other common ways to end a conversation with “anyway”: “Anyway, it was nice to see you”; “Anyway, I have to go”; “Anyway, I really should get going”; “Anyway, I’m going to go.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Well” can be used in a similar way and replace “Anyway” in all of the examples above.</span></p>
			<p class="meaning1"><span class="bold">3.</span>used for indicating or asking about the real reason for or cause of something</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Why did you do that, anyway?”<br class="calibre6" />“Why didn’t you call me, anyway?”<br class="calibre6" />“Their breakup was for the best. They never got along, anyway.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Where is he, anyway?”</span></p>
			<p class="description">“Where is Leo, anyway?” This question wants to know about Leo’s current location. When you use “anyway” in this way, use it at the end of a sentence. You can use it at the start as well, but if you do, it sounds like you are changing the focus of the topic. It still makes sense and it works, but it does not serve the exact same function.</p>
			<p class="description">Example 3 shows this usage in a declarative sentence. Here are some other common situations with this particular usage: “I didn’t want it anyway”; “I’m glad we didn’t go. I wanted to save money anyway”; “The government is always going to do what they want anyway”; “It’s a good thing that I came with you to the store. I needed to buy a few things anyway.”</p>
			<p class="meaning1"><span class="bold">4.</span>used for introducing a statement that supports what has already been said, or to show that a statement is true despite what has been said before</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I saw a new bike on sale for $80 at the store today, and I needed a new one to get to work this summer anyway, so I bought it.” (support)<br class="calibre6" />“Edgar thinks the information is false. Anyway, I don’t think we can trust him based on his history of lying.” (strong contrast)<br class="calibre6" />“I need to get into better shape, and anyway, I already have a gym membership, so I’m going to start going to the gym 3 times a week.” (support)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Anyway, I don’t think that’s true.” (Regardless of what has been said before this, I do not think it is true.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">You can use “anyway” to show support (examples 1 and 3) or strong contrast (example 2). If you remember that “anyway” is another way to say “in any case” or “at any rate,” this usage is easier to remember. In the end, you are still using “anyway” to shift the focus of the conversation&mdash;to concentrate on a specific part of what you wish to say. In the case of showing strong contrast, think of it as using “regardless.”</p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-326"></a>As I was saying”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for returning the conversation to what the speaker was previously saying; “To return to what I said”<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variation:</span> “Like I was saying,...” (ungrammatical, but used)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Sorry about that interruption, everyone. As I was saying, we need several volunteers to work on Saturday.”<br class="calibre6" />“As I was saying before we took our break, our company had a very successful third quarter.”<br class="calibre6" />“How much did you pay for it?” “As I was saying, I got it on special a couple of days ago, and to answer your question, it cost me $45.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted,...” (This is usually a light-hearted usage that can be spoken among friends.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase to return the conversation to what you were previously talking about. This is a common transition after an interruption, as in example 1. You can use it in informal and formal situations. If the flow of ideas in a conversation is stopped or temporarily paused for any reason, and you want to return the conversation to its original focus, you can use this transitional phrase.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “As I have already mentioned,...” “As I just said,...” “Getting back on track,...”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-327"></a>By the way”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>incidentally; used for adding something new or tangentially related to the conversation, especially something that one has just thought of</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“That was a great game. Thanks for paying for the popcorn, by the way.”<br class="calibre6" />“I’m going to the gym tomorrow. Oh! By the way, I got those running shoes you recommended, and I love them!”<br class="calibre6" />“We had a nice time at my cousin’s birthday. By the way, how was your job interview?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “By the way, did you ever…?” (Did you resolve or do what we had previously discussed? I want to ask you now while it is on my mind.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you think of something to add in the course of a conversation, you can introduce it with “by the way.” It is usually related to the current discussion, but it can be something completely new, as in example 3. Here is another example: “By the way, did you read the email I sent you this morning?” In this case, you and this person were already having a conversation about something else. When you use “by the way,” it’s because you have just remembered something you wanted to say, or you wanted to say in the middle of the conversation. See the related phrases for other ways to think about this phrase.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Use “by the way” at the beginning or the end of a sentence. It is more common to use it at the beginning if you are in the middle of a conversation with minimal pauses. You can also use it in the middle of a sentence if you are just making a side statement in the middle of your conversation. Here are three more examples: “Where did you get that, by the way?”; “By the way, did you ever find out who stole your backpack?”; “I spoke with Tamina, who, by the way, recently got a new job, and she said she didn’t have any problems with our decision.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Before I forget,” “While it’s on my mind,” “While it’s still fresh in my mind”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-328"></a>If you ask me”; “<a id="calibre_link-329"></a>The way I look at it”; “<a id="calibre_link-330"></a>The way I see it”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for emphasizing that one is going to give one’s opinion</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“If you ask me, they should have done this sooner.”<br class="calibre6" />“The way I look at it, social media is mostly a waste of time.”<br class="calibre6" />“If you ask my dad, he’ll tell you that life was better 30 years ago.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “If you ask me, he’s/she’s/they’re right.” (In my opinion, he/she/they are right.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">These phrases gives your listener(s) a sign that you are going to give your opinion on something. Of course, it is often clear that we are giving our opinion or perspective on something without phrases like “I think” or “In my opinion,” but it is still common for people to use phrases such as these to prepare listeners for what comes next. While the phrases “If you ask me,” “The way I look at it,” and “The way I see it” are often used in the first person, they can be used to talk about other people’s opinions and perspectives, as in example 3.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Use “Not if you ask me,” “Not the way I look at it,” or “Not the way I see it” as standalone responses when someone says something you disagree with. For example: “This park is fantastic.” “Not if you ask me. Just look at the grass. It’s all brown and yellow.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “in my opinion,” “personally speaking”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-331"></a>Let’s see”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used when one wants to think carefully about something, try to remember something, or to allow for more time to think about something<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variation:</span> “Let me see”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“How many people did you know at the community centre?” “Let’s see, there was Andy, Eric, Alisha…”<br class="calibre6" />“The best book I’ve ever read? That’s a tough one. Hmm. Let me see.”<br class="calibre6" />“Who do you think is the best candidate for this job?” “Well, let’s see, that depends on what qualities you’re looking for.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Let’s see. We need...” (Used when you are trying to plan or organize something, and you are discussing it for the first time. What actions need to be taken? What things do we need to get?)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this filler phrase when you need more time to think about something or to remember something. It is similar to saying “Give me a moment or two to think about it.” Here are two more examples: “Let’s see, how did we get there last time?”; “Let’s see, how much will this cost with tax?” In both of these cases, the person who says “Let’s see” means they are trying to see with their mind’s eye&mdash;to think carefully about something or to try to remember something. </p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> This phrase is often preceded by the words “now” and “well.” For example: “Now, let’s see, where did I put my glasses?”; “Well, let’s see, what do you think the best way is to do this?”</span></p>
			<p class="description"><span class="charoverride2">Finally, the usage described here is not similar to “Wait and see” or “Let’s see what happens,” which simply mean that patience is required, or that no action is possible, recommended, or necessary.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related responses:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Give me a minute.” “Let me think.”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-332"></a>Look at it this way”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for encouraging others to see something from a different perspective<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common variations:</span> “Look at it another way.” “Think of it this way.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I really don’t want to do this.” “Look at it this way: The sooner you start it, the sooner you’ll finish it.”<br class="calibre6" />“I can’t believe the company promoted him.” “Well, look at it this way: The company could have given the job to Jake, which would have been worse.”<br class="calibre6" />“Before you say anything, look at it this way&mdash;There were no good options in this scenario. We had to pick the lesser of two evils.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Look at it this way: It could have been worse.” (The situation was bad, but it could have been worse.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this transitional phrase to ask someone to change their point of view. This is often used to make people see a situation in a more positive way. Here is one more example: “That was one of the worst vacations I’ve ever had.” “Look at this way: At least you got a good story out of it.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Grammar note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> In writing, because this phrase prepares the listener for more information, it is often followed by a colon (:) or an em-dash (&mdash;).   </span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Look at it like this,” “Look on the bright side”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-333"></a>So”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for beginning a new sentence or conversation, or for changing the subject</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“So, what did you think of the city tour?”<br class="calibre6" />“So, did you watch the game last night?”<br class="calibre6" />“So, what do we do now?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “So, how did it go?” (How was the presentation/job interview/exam/doctor’s appointment/etc. I am curious about the outcome and I hope it went well.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“So” has many uses, but for the purposes of practical conversation, it is most useful as an introductory particle. This means it is used at the beginning of a new sentence. It warms up the listener and lets them know you are going to speak.</p>
			<p class="description">You can think of “so” as a reliable sentence starter when you do not want to be too direct with someone. “So, how was your vacation?” is a warmer and more familiar conversation starter than “How was your vacation?” This makes “so” particularly useful with acquaintances, colleagues, and people we are not as comfortable with or familiar with. However, it is also common among friends. See the common sentence for a popular case of this.</p>
			<p class="description">“So” can also be used to fill in gaps in a conversation or to change the subject. For example: “Oh no. We’re late.” “So, what are we going to do now?”; “The meeting is over. Thank you for your time.” “Thanks for the info, Dave. That was really useful. So, does anyone want to grab lunch with me?” This usage of “so” is slightly more polite than “anyway” in the same situation, as “anyway” tries to disregard what has come before in this case.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “So” is often followed by questions, but it can be followed by declarative sentences as well. Note the following examples: “So, you decided to attend the event after all”; “So, I heard your date went well”; “So, your brother texted me today”; “So, I went to a hockey game last night.”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Now then,...” “Say,...” “You know,...”</span></p>
			<p class="phrase">“<a id="calibre_link-334"></a>Well”</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">Used for filling gaps and pauses in speech. This includes:</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>expressing doubt, curiosity, anger, or surprise<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Common extension:</span> “Well now”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Well, I’m not so sure about that.”<br class="calibre6" />“Well, you should have thought of that sooner!”<br class="calibre6" />“Well, well, well, what do we have here?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Well, that’s interesting.” (I just saw or heard something unexpected or interesting. I am expressing my surprise or curiosity, or I am simply stating a fact.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">“Well” is doubled or tripled to show surprise. This is particularly useful when you catch someone doing something they should not be doing, or something they do not want you to know they are doing. In all of the cases above, however, “well” is used to fill a gap in the conversation. Along with “so” and “anyway,” it is the word people use most to transition from one idea to another in everyday conversation.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Well now” can replace “Well” in all of the examples above. In the case of “Well, well, well, what do we have here?” you can say, “Well now, what do we have here?”</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">2.</span>asking a question, especially when one wants more details or an explanation<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">See also:</span> “So”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Well, what did she say?”<br class="calibre6" />“Well, who is the person responsible for this mess?”<br class="calibre6" />“Well, how can we make this situation better?”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Well, isn’t this nice?” (I think this is nice, either truly or sarcastically depending on the situation. Others will probably expect me to say more after this, but they might also feel like I am waiting for them to say something about the topic.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If someone pauses in the middle of telling you a story, you can say “Well, what happened next?” You can use “well” before a question that asks for more details because you are curious. This is similar to usage 1. You can also use “well” before you ask for an explanation, as in example 2. Finally, you can use “well” before questions in which you want to know the next step of something, as in example 3.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> If you are just starting a conversation with someone, it is still much more common and natural to use “so” instead of “well.” Note the examples: “So, where were you born?” “So, what are your plans for today?” You can use “well” if you are in the middle of a conversation and these questions are relevant to what you have been discussing and you are curious or trying to get more information about someone or something, but not as the starting point of a conversation. With this usage, “well” is also sometimes said with a question intonation, as in the following example: “Well? What do you think of the soup?”</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">3.</span>responding when someone expects something to be the case, or when someone expects the answer to something to be “yes,” but the answer is actually “no”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Did you send the email?” “Well, not exactly.”<br class="calibre6" />“So, did you buy the cookies?” “Well, I really wanted to, but I forgot.”<br class="calibre6" />“You brought the equipment, didn’t you?” “Well, that’s an interesting story…”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Well, not exactly.” (A response to someone. You are saying that what they hoped would be the case is not actually the case.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">In these cases, “well” is being used to create time and space for the speaker. They know the person whom they are speaking to will not like their answer, so they are just trying to delay their answer by filling the space with another word. This usage of well can be quite funny if you stretch the length of “well.” Note the example: “Did you do what I asked?” “Weeeeeeeeeelllllll…” “You didn’t do it?!” “Weeeeell, no. I’m sorry.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">4.</span>introducing an answer to a question</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Well, that’s a very good question.”<br class="calibre6" />“Well, the truth is I haven’t done it yet because I haven’t had any free time.”<br class="calibre6" />“What have you been doing all this time?” “Well, I’ve actually been working on an important personal project.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Well, I’m glad you asked.” (I am happy you asked this question because I know the answer, or I am excited to discuss this topic.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This usage “warms up” the conversation and is another case of “well” acting as a filler word before you say what you really want to say, or what is relevant to the conversation.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “So” would also work in all of the examples above.</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">5.</span>filling space in the middle of a sentence because one needs more time to think about what they want to say</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“I talked to him, and, well, I didn’t get the answer that I wanted.”<br class="calibre6" />“Your answer was a little…well…too aggressive.”<br class="calibre6" />“I don’t know why we have to…well…work so many extra hours.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “That’s…well…difficult to say.” (I do not have a good answer for this question/situation/etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you need more time to think about what you want to say, either because you are struggling to find the right words, or you do not want to be too hurtful to the person whom you are speaking to, “well” in the middle of a conversation can be a useful filler. Here is another example: “I’m not sure if, well, they’ll actually listen to me.”</p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">6.</span>ending a conversation, presentation, etc.<br class="calibre6" /><span class="charoverride">Similar, see also:</span> “Anyway”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Well, I think we’ll stop there for today. Have a great day, everybody!”<br class="calibre6" />“Well, that’s all for now. Thanks for your time and attention.”<br class="calibre6" />“Well, I’ve got to go. See you tomorrow!”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Well, I should probably get going.” (I should probably go. I do not want to be late for my next event.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">If you are not sure how to end a conversation, starting with “well” (or “anyway”) is a good idea. Since “well” is a filler word that prepares the listener for more information, it is a good way to get someone’s attention and to indicate that you want or need to end the conversation. It is a shorter and “sharper” way to indicate that you want to end a conversation. “Anyway” is a bit gentler and more relaxed, though you can make “well” sound more relaxed by extending its pronunciation (”Weeeell, I should probably go”).</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“According to my weather app, it’s going to rain tomorrow.”<br class="calibre6" />“Did he commit the crime?” “Not according to official reports.”<br class="calibre6" />“According to the official company policy, she should be reprimanded.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “According to who?” (Who said that, or where did you get that information? I am skeptical of your statement. Note that “who” is ungrammatical here and should be “whom,” but “who” is what is used and what sounds most natural to the vast majority of listeners.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase when you want to point to the source of your information. Who said it, or where was it stated? This is useful in speaking and in writing. University professors will want to know where you acquired your information for an essay, for instance. Note the example: “According to the stoic philosopher Lucius Seneca, all cruelty comes from weakness.”</p>
			<p class="description">In a conversation, you can use the negative form of this phrase to counter what someone else has said by referring to a source of information which provides contrary information. For example: “It’s 6 o’clock.” “Not according to my phone.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2">  “according to official reports,” “according to various sources”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “Play according to the rules.” (Play in a way that follows and respects the rules. Do not use illegal tactics.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This usage often refers to a set of rules, principles, instructions, or policies that are written somewhere, but it can refer to a person as well. If you follow someone or something as a guide when you are doing something, you are doing it according to that thing or person. Here is one more example: “If we don’t do this according to the client’s specifications, we won’t get paid.” In short, there is accord (or harmony) between the action and someone or something’s expectations.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrases:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “consistent with,” “in agreement with,” “play by the rules”</span></p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “I lasted as long as I could.” (I tried my best to continue the activity until I could not do it anymore.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">This usage strictly refers to a length of time. Some common extensions of this phrase include “as long as I live,” “as long as I do,” “as long as I can,” and “as long as I’ve known you.” This usage can be used to make a comparison, as in example 3, or to specify a particular duration or period or time, as in examples 1 and 2. A popular appearance of this phrase is in wedding vows. After a series of promises regarding fidelity and honesty, the phrase “as long as you both shall live” is stated at the end by the wedding officiant, meaning the promises made will be kept for the duration of the couple’s lives.</p>

			<p class="description">This usage introduces a condition that must be satisfied before the cause is activated. Here is one more example: “You can take my car tonight as long as you fill up the gas tank.” Here, the person who wants to borrow the car must fill up the gas tank to use the car. Finally, a popular appearance of this phrase is in the Backstreet Boys song “As long as you love me.”</p>
			<p class="description">This phrase is similar to saying “if” or “only if.”</p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	Finish the idea: “You can go to the party as long as...”</p>

			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> Another way to say “It won’t take as long as 2 hours” is “It won’t take longer than 2 hours.” In both cases, you are referring to the maximum amount of time that something will require.

			<p class="phrase"><a id="calibre_link-341"></a>so much for</p>
			<p class="phrase-sub"><span class="charoverride2">idiomatic phrase</span></p>
			<p class="meaning"><span class="bold">1.</span>used for saying that something is no longer true, useful, helpful, or possible (because something has failed to make one feel this way or for this to actually be the case)</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Examples</span>:	“Bret and Julie got divorced? So much for everlasting love.”<br class="calibre6" />“He betrayed his country. So much for patriotism!”<br class="calibre6" />“Well, that didn’t work. So much for that idea.”</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Common sentence:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “So much for that idea.” (That idea does not or did not work. We can discard it as an option for our current problem/situation/etc.)</span></p>
			<p class="description">Use this phrase to express your disappointment or contempt that something has failed. The related phrase “There goes” is a useful synonym for understanding “so much for.” Note the two examples: “Someone hit Mario’s car in the parking lot. So much for his new car”; “Someone hit Mario’s car in the parking lot. There goes his new car.” In both cases, Mario’s new car is no longer useful. Imagine yourself throwing away the object that comes after “so much for.” It is no longer true, useful, helpful, or possible. As you can see in examples 1 and 2, this can also refer to abstract ideas such as love, loyalty, honesty, etc.</p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Usage note:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “So much for” is often followed by a noun (“So much for justice”) or noun phrase (“So much for my life’s work”), but it can be followed by a gerund as well. Note the example: “So much for believing in the innate goodness of humanity.” As you can see, you can use this structure to sound sarcastic, cynical, and/or dramatic.</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Collocations:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “so much for honesty/loyalty/love/justice/etc.,” “so much for that,” “so much for that idea”</span></p>
			<p class="example"><span class="charoverride">Related phrase:</span><span class="charoverride2"> “There goes [something]”</span></p>
			<p class="practice"><span class="charoverride">Practice:</span>	Think of a time a plan didn’t work out for you. Use the phrase “So much for...” to express what failed. Use a verb+ing in this case as well. (Ex: “So much for visiting my brother this weekend.” In this case, I had planned to visit my brother, but maybe my car stopped working, and this prevented me from visiting him.)</p>

			<p class="body-text2">Alex Makar is a Polish-Canadian immigrant who has been teaching English in and out of classrooms since 2007. In 2009, he decided it would be a good idea to show his face to millions of people on YouTube and on engvid.com. He has not regretted this decision. </p>
			<p class="body-text2">These days, Alex resides in the province of Quebec with his wife and two daughters. When he’s not answering English language questions or writing books, Alex enjoys reading, watching movies, playing board games, collecting nerdy t-shirts, pretending to maintain a regular exercise routine, listening to music, and learning from his kids.</p>
			<p class="body-text2"><span class="italic">300 Practical English Words and Phrases</span> is Alex’s third book. If you enjoyed it, make sure to get his first two books, <a href="https://www.englishalex.com/product-page/100-practical-english-phrasal-verbs-epub"><span class="italic">100 Practical English Phrasal Verbs</span></a> and <a href="https://www.englishalex.com/product-page/200-practical-english-idioms-pdf"><span class="italic">200 Practical English Idioms</span></a>. Alex says they are also quite useful!  </p>
